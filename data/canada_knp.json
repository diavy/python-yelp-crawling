I had it x-rayed and physical therapied for a few months before it finally stopped bothering me, but it still flared up from time to time. My husband and I came to pass the summer in Montreal and shortly after arrival, my knee started aching every evening. He's Quebecois and raved about osteopathy and suggested I go see an osteopath while here. I found Clinique Altermed on yelp and looked at a few reviews elsewhere and decided to book a session with Benjamin Amran.", "Benjamin has a very cheerful disposition that quickly put me at ease. The treatment definitely seemed a bit weird as a first-timer - lots of pressing and tapping and deep breathing and long silences. He worked on some other body parts that he found to be out of balance and at times the pressure was really uncomfortable, but not unbearable.", "Long story short, after 1 session, my knee pretty much stopped bugging me, other than a slight twitch after a couple of weeks. I went for a follow up session and it's now been 4 weeks and my knee hasn't bugged me a bit, even after a week of marching up and down the hills of Quebec City. I'm amazed! And every time I mentioned my good experience to other folks here, they all chime in with similar osteopathy experiences. ", "Making appointments was super simple to do online and the price to me was very reasonable. The clinic offers different fees based on the level of experience of your osteopath, but I think Benjamin is worth a splurge. While we mostly conversed in French, he seemed comfortable enough to do treatment in English. The space was clean; I never waited long and everyone greeted me with a smile. I'd trek up here from NYC in a heartbeat the next time I need similar treatment. Highly recommended."]},

He noticed a few things right away that I needed to work on and put me back on the treadmill to work on those issues so I could feel the difference.

After not being able to walk for almost 6 weeks with his stent and informing him that I was seeing an orthopedic surgeon for a second opinion, he decided all of a sudden he needed to remove the implant, probably so his scam wouldn't be discovered. He wrenched that stent out of my foot so carelessly and with such great difficulty I was left in unbelievable agony the next day and had to go to the hospital. I later found out that this fake stent was covered in a coating that was probably the cause of the extreme pain when trying to stand and the difficulty removing it and also that this procedure was not appropriate for my condition even if it had been a real stent!

Appointments are very quick, and at first I thought that the adjustments weren't doing a thing, because they didn't feel like much. That wasn't the case. You don't need to have your back wrenched and popped this way and that to receive good chiropractic care. This new method, Torque Release Technique is so much less invasive.

I am always seen very quickly when I come in for my appointment. Dr. Jassal seems to genuinely care about making me healthier and happier. If something has been giving me grief lately (like my hip flexor last week, or a recent migraine, etc.) he'll focus on trying to relieve that stress from my body, as well as continuing with my regular care. Questions are taken seriously and simple and clear answers are given so that I understand what is going on.

It was my first time visiting a naturopath and I was under the impression that they are \" real doctors\" but perhaps have been given an unfair bad rap by the conventional medical practices. I also thought that the naturopaths objective is to assist the bodies natural healing processes through various supportive measures.", "The experience did not match any of my pre conceived ideas about an earthy, compassionate interest in my well being. The doctor spoke so fast that it was impossible to catch entire sentences of what she was saying. It seemed that she had a canned presentation that involved making a pitch on a myriad of expensive lab tests, and then she talked about various injections and a treatment plan for imbalances in hormones, glucose, adrenal glands, thyroid, etc. This was entirely her agenda and had absolutely nothing to do with patient autonomy. My impression is that she reviewed the five or six page intake form that is required in advance, and then created her plan of action before I even arrived. We were on different pages the entire visit.", "I was an RN for over thirty years so I questioned the rationale for some of those lab tests. She said, \"well, if you can't afford these...we could do such and such.\" At the very end of the one hour consult, and right out of the blue, she produced a 3 cc syringe and approached me saying that she was going to inject something ( I was not sure if she said Dexamethasone, or dextrose and alcohol) into the nerve beside my left eye, and also inject the same substance into my Achilles' tendon. \u00a0I was quite taken aback and said, \"no way!\".", "In addition, she had a very strong opinion that one should eat very little fruit, and seemed to think that because I eat a lot of fruit that I must have blood sugars that are out of whack, which is simply not true. Insulin resistance is determined by factors such as waist to hip ratio, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, diet high in processed food, \u00a0and genetic factors. She also told me that the vertical ridges on my fingernails are a sign of protein deficiency. But, that is simply not true. Vertical ridges on finger nails is a sign of aging and quite normal. ", "The clincher for me, and reason for this low rating is that the ND did not examine me, or even take my pulse or blood pressure. If she had concerns about blood glucose, She could have done a simple random blood glucometer reading in her office. In my opinion, and experience, there is a great deal that can be gleaned about a patients overall health if you take the pulse for a full minute and a manual blood pressure reading. The other basic and rule of thumb for most practitioners, is that you never inject a person with any substance without having them wait for 15-30 minutes following the injection, in case there is an adverse reaction. To me, these are things that are as basic as it gets. I had always believed that naturopaths get a bad rap. Now I know why."]},

I have been hoping to finally get past an old, old neck problem that really limits my range of motion so in November I decided to return to the acupuncturist I liked a few years ago all the way out in Eagle Rock. However, she has now moved to Los Feliz and there's simply no way to make that work for a number of consecutive treatments driving from Redlands! So, I yelped acupuncture places and also asked my chiropractor. On yelp I found Blissful Wellness...today was my first appointment! Amazing! I also tried a gal in Redlands recommended by the chiropractor but Blissful is far and away better than the other two (the woman in Los Feliz and the woman in Redlands). ", "Let me begin with the Blissful office is a bit tough to find (at least it was for me) but I called and they guided me right in. The front office is nicely done and super clean. The treatment room was also nicely appointed and super clean. Those things are great and add to the experience but check this out...the doctor listened, observed, wrote down some notes and then actually put his hands on my neck and massaged around to figure out what could be wrong. He had me turn my head this way and that way and felt the muscles move or lock up and asked questions and then made a treatment decision! There is a woman who does a pre-massage for about ten minutes to loosen up the area to be treated, then the doctor does the acupuncture and while being the needles are in place, he uses infrared lights to penetrate heat to the area. The woman in Los Feliz also used the infrared light but not the woman in Redlands. \u00a0I love that addition because it is a really nice heat that remains constant but doesn't overheat the skin. Interesting! ", "Anyway, here's another fabulous part of my visit...I just checked messages and Blissful Wellness called to see how I'm feeling after the treatment and to give suggestions for any post-treatment discomfort I may be experiencing and also encouraged me to do any stretching the doctor recommended Oh yea...the doctor totally gave me stretches to do and suggestions for where to place my hands on the steering wheel (I drive a lot for work) and while at the computer!", "I'm sold! The office is a bit far for me (30 minutes or so) but totally worth the drive! Years ago I lived in San Francisco and started having acupuncture treatments there just for general wellness. I'm glad to find a place where I feel like I'm in good hands here in Southern California! ", "I'm even feeling confident that after a number of treatments and if I keep up the stretches, I'll be able to turn my head to look at my children in the back seat of the car again someday!!!

If you are just starting out to run, or even a seasoned runner who has never had a gait test and really had someone explain shoe mechanics to you- I strongly suggest going here. You will save yourself a world of pain. ", "Nick put my dad on the treadmill and had him run on it to show how his stride was- we talked about his ankle alignment, his over pronation (where his arch collapses inward slightly which can cause all sorts of issues) and also a tight Achilles and the importance of stretching it and having a shoe with good solid heel support. After identifying issues and also dad's strengths in his form, we went on to look at shoes. Here is where I really appreciated him- he opened first \"Were you looking at getting a fitting for shoes today?\" Which was a great way to take the pressure off of the sale. I really felt that no matter what, he was happy to just give us the information that we needed. ", "We went through several shoes and sizes and widths for my dad before we found one that worked really well, and also was a Brooks shoe (my favorite). In the end I bought this shoe and then found out it was on sale, double score there. I had some pretty technical questions for Nick (does my dad need an insert like super feet? Or does this over rotate his pronation?) and every question he had an answer for. He smiled the whole time, encouraged us to bring our dog in that was sitting in the car, and really did a great job on helping us. He helped me switch out the laces (the bright colors were too cool for dad) and helped me put in a runners knot for him too. ", "So if you are torn over which place to go for shoes- please start here. Running will only make worse any alignment or muscle weaknesses you have in your feet and legs, and you owe it to yourself to have someone help you pick out the right shoe with the right support and technology for your specific feet. Have someone with a LOT more training and a college degree in this will help you into shoes that will support your running."]},

", "I have been a loyal customer to Kintec as a whole for years, starting with the Port Moody location. For the first few years when I lived near that store, I was getting great service, and good selection of shoes. Since then I moved to Vancouver so I have been trying this location. These days, especially now that I have a M-F job, their hours are difficult (10 to 6 on weekdays, no Sundays and usually closed during holidays and some none-holidays. You need to check online before you come down here), and I also find that their selection for men's shoes are highly limited. They do not have any way to check the inventory online before I go into the store, and it's tough to get a hold of them by phone. They also do not keep their promises to return your calls. Two recent visits to this location resulted in no shoes found that worked for me as their selection in store is pretty bad, and I have fairly average sized feet. I tried online ordering but I found that the sizing for each shoe is different, so getting the right size has been tough. Despite their \"100% satisfaction guarantee\", if you try the shoes out for a run and don't like it, you can't get a refund or store credit, so online purchases are a huge gamble. More importantly, any SALE items are FINAL SALE and there is NO REFUND or RETURNS!! Even if your purchase qualifies for a return, you pay the postage fee. So with that in mind, their \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" is in fact pretty much a sham. I have 3 pairs of shoes from Kintec online that did not work out after trying them out for a couple of days, so they went to Big Brothers. ", "All in all, I miss when I can go in to the store, and find the right shoes, but those days are gone now, or maybe Port Moody location was just better. I miss getting good advice as an overpronator, which is not something I can expect from big box stores, but what can I do if Kintect just does not have enough inventory? It's not like their prices are better either so I guess I have to try other places now."]},

I want to say, in April of last year, i had finished my season as a ski patroler, \u00a0and took on playing senior hockey with a vengance.. too much. \u00a0During the 5th game in 2 weeks, i fell without being able to brace myself, i did not feel any immediate pain, just knew i hit the ice pretty hard. That night my left leg started to be sore, my lower right back was very painful, and standing in one spot, longer than a minute, was out of the question..I could not relieve the pain unless i sat down, crouched. Sleep was broken at best, only one slightly comfortable position. I sought the assistance of a chiropractor, Dr. Rubina , Urban Chiropractic Inc., who took me in right away, looked me over, she suggested i visit a friend of hers for x-rays that night, which i did. It turns out a previous unknown disc injury had raised it's ugly head and now i was suffering a full blown pinched Sciatic nerve...If your reading this, you might already know how much discomfort this damn concern is. \u00a0Dr. Rubina suggested i visit the Sports and Spinal Physical Therapy clinic, around the corner, on Homer, to see if they could assist me.. At this point anything is better, i would try anything, my discomfort was now becoming a major problem for my. I called the clinic and was seen by Colin Miller the next day.. My first \u00a0examination led Colin to believe that the muscles where too tight to do any spinal decompression, but he did treat me with acupuncture and told me that it may improve but i needed to come back in a day or two to see if the muscles had relaxed a bit.. Too which i did, and they had.. On the second visit, the acupuncture was again used, then a spinal decompression, light tension...after my session Colin told me to walk around the block for 10 minutes before i sat down in the car, i was still in pain, but less... So i walked.. at the end of the walk, i remember so vividly thinking i felt normal, no pain.. none..After a day the pain was returning, but on a scale of 1 - 10, 10 being prior to any treatment, i was \u00a0a 3. \u00a0I had scheduled a third appointment for a few days hence and after the third appointment, the pain level was zero, and i spelled it out to ensure you did not think it was a typo... ZERO.. \u00a0We had booked a \u00a0short vacation and i wanted to ensure no hiccups while away so i booked a 4th appointment for the next week, prior to leaving, and with no pain between the 3rd and 4th treatments I was amazed.. Still today, i cannot believe how you can go from such pain, to none in such a short period of time.. That was last may, this is Jan.2013..still no pain, i have done the grind 2X a week, all summer, still playing hockey, ski patrolling again, and no pain.. even did the polar bear swim... I cant tell you how well it will work for you, but i believe that if i had some idea of the service Colin and his crew could provide, i would have had hope... And within \u00a0the short period of time it took me to find him, i had no hope..very dark time indeed.. Colin, you and your crew are forever angels in my eyes, i tell everyone about your services, my hockey mates, sauna mates.. no one deserves to suffer unnecessarily.. and to Dr. Rubina who nailed it right off the bat..by hats off to the both of you...thank you so much..Brian Bell"]},

", "There are a few bursts of fresh air in the tank, but most of the time it's kind of balmy and smelling of chlorine. I think if you have claustrophobia, this is most definitely not for you. If you are only mildly affected by the enclosed space, I think it's optional to keep the door slightly open as the rest of the room is shower space and private to you alone anyhow. ", "The last thing I noticed is that you can hear other clicks and doors and stuff outside the room which to me were really disruptive. I think because I'm suffering from high anxiety right now I kept worrying that someone was going to come into the room and steal my bag or open the door. Obviously none of those things happened, but the noise does carry in this building b/c of the high ceilings. ", "Overall, I'd say the price and the spa were very reasonable. I would definitely revisit it b/c I felt like my muscles really benefited from the treatment and it was quite relaxing to float for a whole hour.

For anyone who is remotely claustrophobic I highly recommend pure float because they use float ROOMS not float pods and The float rooms truly are spacious. The staff is friendly and everything was very clean. For first time floaters they explain how you must shower first including washing your hair, but they neglect to explain that you must NOT condition your hair until your post float shower. They provide u with all the shampoo, body wash and conditioner and the containers mounted on the wall in the shower are labeled pre float and post so it was simple to figure out on your own. Yes you really do float - everyone does but pure float also provides several little floatation devices if you wish to enhance the float - like a noodle for behind your knees and a neck float to keep your head floating higher. I experimented with both but found I was most comfortable with nothing. They provide ear plugs too which are highly recommended to avoid swimmers ear and they also enhance the quiet atmosphere and sensory deprivation if you chose to turn off all of the lights in the float room. I am extremely claustrophobic and was completely comfortable the entire time - However I did leave both lights on (the blue light in the water and the star light on the ceiling) because I did start to feel panicked when I tried to float in total darkness with all of the lights out. I myself am not an avid meditator and I believe that my experience would have been much more powerful if I was a regular meditator. From several things I read and recommendations from friends I was expecting my first float experience to be amazing but I was disappointing that it did not blow me away. The 60 min float was plenty - any longer and I think I would have started getting anxious. It was a nice experience overall but it wasn't amazing and I didn't really notice any lasting effects other than my hair was SUPER DUPER soft for about a week afterwards. Do be sure to heed the suggestion/warning about NOT shaving for at least 24 hours prior b/c the slaty water will sting- I made sure not to shave I had a scratch on my elbow that stung."]},

Got my heat packs right away. 1020: After 20mins I took off my hot packs because I usually only leave them on no more no less. 1035 no one has said anything not letting me know that there would be a bit of a wait. 1045: I gave up waiting for someone to acknowledge me. Asked the receptionist to reschedule. Let her know the situation. She was nice and offered to ask the tech what the plan was but I declined. I think I was already frustrated and annoyed.

Other places I've been to in the past will only 'listen' and spend maybe 10 minutes in one area not giving your trouble spots the attention that it needs.

As a professional basketball player living in the IE, I always hoped to have a place like the Recovery Lab near by. Going to LA everyday for Cryo is a little much for me. When I heard about this place in Rancho I was excited and it did not disappoint. First off, the staff. Great people who I now consider friends. Louis and Little are the best. Both seem to love what they do and are always willing to make the effort to make sure you feel comfortable. Cryo is something I have done before in the past and something I find extremely useful for the body. The price is great compared to what sessions cost in LA so that is also a plus. Very clean and welcoming environment. I am now overseas about to start training camp and my body feels great thanks to my guys at the recovery lab. Cant wait until next summer to take care of the body but also to be around the two most genuine dudes, Louis and Little.."]},

I did notice that employee's take like a 10 minute break in between customers and I can only imagine how tired they must get but haven't showed me at least any signs of fatigue when the session begins. Just as you would expect, they soak your feet in medium warm water temperature that has a plastic liner for disposal afterward. They start at your forehead with a natural moisturizer and apply pressure toward temples, ear (pinna), and direct pressure at scalp. They apply more moisturizer and continue on each side of your neck with emphasis around your juggler vain shifting toward shoulder. By the time they transition to your feet, if you're anything like me, I am so ready to fall asleep. I wouldn't recommend if you're experiencing severe chronic back pain only for the main reason that no one here is licensed, this is more of a leisure massage to help polish off the edge and chase a few knots away.", "The store presents itself very clean and each sofa/foot chair has a new set of towels, blanket and replacement pillow with case as new session begins.

I like to wear shorts with a loose Nike sport top, baseball cap and flip flops.", "Management is very professional and friendly who remember your face and greet you with a warm smile.

In fact, I enjoyed my experience so much that I purchased five 60-minute foot massages for $100, with May! =)", "Even though there was a rowdy group of males outside that couldn't be ignored, the music was exactly what my mind needed to relax me.

The only thing that bothered me was the outside noise coming in. For whatever reason, the receptionist left the front door open and loud cars and random kids playing and yelling were heard here and there. Also, the bright lighting at the front would slightly spill out into the main massage room, but I guess you just have to close your eyes and forget about it. The actual massage was good...not too hard and not too soft. It was your typical reflexology: you soak your feet in water (you can pay an extra $5 for them to add some scents or moisturizers in the bucket), they massage your body and feet. There's also a private massage area that is just separated by a curtain. I'm guessing that's if you pay for a different massage (maybe the $30 one that seems to be the popular choice). The only thing that I didn't like is that they didn't use any hot oil or stones. I've been to other reflexology places that do those extras little things for the same price.

Today I've had a bad headache for about 26 hours which start from neck/shoulder pain. I asked the front if I should do the regular $25 hour foot reflexology or the $30 combo. He said the combo because they would get the neck/shoulder area a bit better. I also knew that a lot of yelpers recommended the combo. I am so glad I did the combo! It started out as reflexology - laying out in the main room while she massaged my scalp and neck, arms, feet & legs. I was drifting off to sleep. It was wonderful. My personal preference is she could have given more pressure but I didn't say anything either. Then she asked me to go in the private room area. I'm not sure if it was a different person but this time the person was massage & hitting the knots in my shoulder/neck area. Next time I'm going to ask how much to add on extra time to focus on an area - my muscles are so tight. I think I will buy the 5 combo massages for $150 & get a 6th combo free.

I get that it's a form of promoting business, but let's take it back a few years when social media didn't exist how would your business be successful? That's how it should be I know successful business owners and they don't use social media. Think about this you go to a restaurant you have a great experience how likely are you to comment? Vs you have a bad experience how likely are you to complain? Exactly my point people on my facebook are gonna know regardless of my experience and posting all this positivity just so I follow the contract really doesn't mean anything. People on my social media will know the truth positive and negative when I tell them in person and they see the results themselves, there is no reason for them to have to read it or see it posted constantly over and over the same thing. So what people write here may be completely false because they just want to get their money back. I can logically and creatively think of a bunch of other ways to promote this business and have a more successful outcome! First being, not requiring challengers or members to check in on facebook, just like a drug addict the person has to be willing to accept the help in order to make changes and become sober, challengers should want to post stuff on THEIR social media!"]},

It's $500 upfront FYI and you have to keep taking the challenge multiple times if you are considered \"over weight\" for your height. I started at 151, at their weight I was only considered 6 lbs over weight and their target weight for me was 145. I didn't think much of it and was just excited to follow the diet plan and workout and loose 20 lbs, (assuming I had 20 lbs on me to loose...) Completely wrong! My first two weigh ins I was only down 2 lbs.... I was very frustrated being that I Followed the Damn Instructions to the t! Although I was down a pant size by then. By my fourth week I was only down 7 lbs. I felt really good and was almost down another pant size! I was getting compliments like crazy!!! I started carb cycling and still was not loosing anymore weight! I actually gained a pound! We were constantly lifting heavy weights and to loose 13 lbs seemed impossible!... Meanwhile I researched The Camp and found out they have multiple challenges! I was forcing myself down to be 131, which I know is impossible because of my body figure, I am very heavy chested which was where most of my weight was carried and I had no idea they had a body fat/ bikini challenge!!!! That challenge would have been a better fit for me being that I wasn't really overweight!!!! I feel that the girl signed me up too quick and was quick to take my money and didn't explain much nor did she recommend me to join the bikini challenge instead. I really feel that this is great for someone that is severely over weight or maybe just to be a member because their workouts are crazy, insanely, awesome and very convenient! \u00a0But I feel scammed being that I signed up for a challenge to loose 20 lbs when their target for me was to loose 6 pounds and made it impossible to loose 20 lbs with constant heavy weights. What's more embarrassing is I had to check in on Facebook every workout and I had all my family, friends and coworkers cheering me on to loose 20 lbs and I couldn't loose the 20 lbs because I DIDN'T HAVE 20 LBS ON ME TO LOOSE!! I was placed in a wrong program and was left very let down and discouraged! I would not recommend any family or friend to sign up for this challenge as I have shared my experience to many family and friends already!"]},

However, yesterday I had a brutal neck/shoulder flare up and so I went online to see about getting a massage to help loosen things up. Was able to get in with Thom Williamson at Grant Street Wellness on the same day. I can honestly say this was probably the best massage I've ever had. He understood that I wasn't there just to \"relax\", rather I needed someone to really focus on the points of muscle that were pinching and not be too delicate when applying pressure. He found some trigger points on my back that I didn't even realize were in so much pain that no specialist has ever found before. He uses the graston technique which I'd experienced with a chiropractor in the past and it's great for smoothing out muscle tension. He took extra time and suggested a couple exercises afterwards (which all specialists tend to do and are usually somewhat pitiful for someone who is an ex athlete/fitness conscious), however he showed me this wicked idea of using a tennis ball to place on my trigger points while stretching which is brilliant. If you are an athlete with lingering pain from old injuries, or just in a similar situation then I highly recommend seeing Thom. I will definitely be going back. Cheers!"]},

", "While I have no issue with anyone whom I interacted with personally-- both the receptionist and my masseuse seemed like pleasant, good natured people--there were a number of things that I found unacceptable and unprofessional. ", "1) There was no questionnaire asking of my physical/medical history. I have actually never in my life had a massage from a place that did not request SOME KIND of history. Which is hilarious because on their waiver, it states that you \"acknowledge that you have answered honestly to all medical history questions\" (I am of course paraphrasing, but that is what the sentence meant). I brought this up to the receptionists attention, who admitted she had never actually read the waiver (now please know she was super sweet. BUT...wtf? Seriously?This is your job...) She said she would bring it up with the owner, but that the masseuse would be asking me questions when I went in. Not only did my masseuse not ask me any questions, she didn't actually introduce herself... ", "So I am now entering a massage with someone who has no idea of any of my medical history, and has not thought to ask if I even have any pre-existing injuries... I was so put-off that I was already hesitant and tense before we even began, and after we began, it only got worse...", "2) The masseuse, whom I found out was named Tatanya through one of the endless stories she told, talked through the entire session. And I don't mean talked about the massage, or my muscles, or what she was doing. She just talked. Non-stop. At first I thought that my obvious non-engagement of conversation (I replied only when I had to, with one word, and asked no questions/offered no further information, and mostly just pursed-lipped 'hmm'-ed) would deter her, but nope. I initially felt bad about writing this part, because she was not a 'bad' person, however that is not what this is about. This is a criticism of her as a professional, which she was not. She remained completely oblivious of my growing annoyance at constantly having my massage interrupted, and she also continuously stopped to show me 'exercises' I should do for my back. Now, this is important: She is completely unqualified to be giving out any kind of routine to be done at home. She is also not qualified to modify/and or adjust my spine, which I had to stop her from doing because yo, lady, I don't trust you, and that's not your job. \u00a0It is actually in the waiver that they are not qualified to be giving medical assessments, and nothing said in the duration of your session should be construed as such. It ALSO states that they cannot realign your spine, etc, etc... So not only had the receptionist never read the waiver she hands out, neither do any of the therapists? On top of that, the massage was haphazard and unfocused-- BECAUSE SHE TALKED SO MUCH. Despite my saying I would like her to focus on my lower back, that was the area she focused on the least (at BEST 10 minutes. But much more like 5...) and spent a bunch of time on my head/shoulders, where she could be seated... She interrupted the massage constantly to talk more animatedly, and in general her energy (while not unkind) was so frenetic it was impossible to relax, let alone trust that she knew what she was doing.", "Now for me what makes my experience unacceptable is that I read all of the yelp reviews previously made here before booking my appointment. There has already been a review in regards to the unprofessional manner of (as it happens, Tatanya) the masseuse talking non-stop throughout the session. The reason I chose to book my appointment anyway, was that the company had replied to all of their negative reviews, both apologizing for the negative occurrence, and assuring that they would address the various issues. To me, the fact that this happened AGAIN is appalling. There is absolutely no excuse for not addressed a problem as basic (and frankly, common sense) as 'Do Not Talk About Yourself, Your Children, And Your Various Weekend Activities While Giving A Massage To A Patient'.

She went through the massage where she would start and end and got started right away, about 5 min in she then asked if I wanted a deep tissue(which I did I do a lot of lifting at work so I love deep tissue) The pressure she gave was perfect - I could have probably even taken it a little firmer but I didn't want to hurt badly the next day, \u00a0she also noticed I had a large bruise above my knee and ask if it hurt before she touched it. after the massage, she asked if i wanted a glass of water, and had one waiting for me when i was dressed.

Beware - it's a long one. ", "Having HAD to visit the spa three times now \u00a0- I stupidly bought way too many Indulge Living vouchers - I feel completely confident in my single star rating. The single star is basically a pat on the back for maintaining a clean & hygienic facility. ", "On my three visits, I had a deep tissue and two lymphatic drainage massages (in that order). For my deep tissue massage I asked for Walter, who came highly recommended by a friend. What I got the day of was a brush off excuse from front desk that they'd switched my therapist to a small Chinese woman who gave me a sub-par massage. ", "For my first lymphatic massage I again requested Walter and yet again received a small Asian lady and no explanations for the switch. This time the massage was just plain awful. At one point my masseuse climbed on to my back and started using her FEET to press into my leg muscles. Gross! ", "After that you'd think I'd never come back. Unfortunately, I had two more vouchers so convinced a friend to come with me and give the place one last chance. This time I called ahead and spoke to a lady who explained that I'd previously experienced the \"Chinese\" method for lymphatic massage, and my friend's experience \u00a0with Walter was the gentler \"Western\" method. She assured me that on this visit I would be assigned someone who was versed in the Western method. ", "I showed up on the day with my friend and we were assigned separate rooms. A soft spoken European girl showed me to my room and left me so I could strip down and get under the sheets. Good start. So what happens as I'm mid-strip and topless? A small Chinese woman suddenly barges into the room without knocking! Apparently she's to be my \"new masseuse\" as the owner had reassigned the European girl to my friend. And from there it only got worse....", "After lying down on the massage table, for almost ten minutes the lady kept going in and out of the room and digging into some black bag she had for various bottles of stuff. At one point she opened the door and hit me right in the head, and yes it left a bruise the next day. The massage that occurred when it finally commenced can only be described as one of the worst and most uncomfortable experiences of my life. ", "The lady spent half the time literally straddling my back, again feet were used, and my disclosure about a shoulder injury was completely ignored as she jabbed her elbows into it. But the WORST part was when she proceeded to pull my arms backwards until my bare chest was lifted from the table and completely exposed. Google \"Yoga Bow Pose\" and tell me that's not weird especially when the girl is TOPLESS. At that point I almost lost it, but the lady got off me and started cleaning up. Just as I thought I'd escaped, she launched one last attack - spraying me with various bottles of weird scented tonic until my hair was literally soaked with the stuff. ", "All of this occurred in the midst of a ridiculous amount of noise coming from reception. Mr.Front Desk had a visitor who felt the need to share her cheesy flirtations and hyena laugh with all the spa guests. Even my friend who was lucky enough to land one of the rooms at the end of the hall could hear her. Sent my girl out twice to complain - zero difference.", "As a result of my experience at swan spa, I now refuse to buy massage vouchers from those deal sites. I pay full price to go somewhere reputable with certified massage therapists that actually know what they're doing."]},

The walls are far from being soundproofed, meaning I could hear sirens, trucks, and customers talking at the front desk.

Maybe noise isn't such an issue for rooms in the back, but I was Room 6, which is in the front right past the lounge area.The warm stones were very soothing, but the clattering noises from stones being pulled out of the warmer disturbed the peace. That being said, I won't let that stop me from booking hot stone massages!", "Lastly, my massage started about 10min behind schedule, even though I arrived for my treatment 5min prior to my appointment. In all fairness to them, they did run over time to give me my full hour-long massage, and I was offered some really delicious tea while I waited. ", "The only reason I came here twice was because I had bought vouchers from Indulge Living for a great price. I don't think I'll be jumping at the chance to return for a full price treatment. Maybe if I have time to kill while in the area. Speaking of which, great location! About a block away from Waterfront Station, so at least it's got that going for it."]},

A friend and I booked services here after our Massage Therapy Board Exams in 2007. She booked a relaxation massage and received a deep tissue massage so painful she almost cried. I booked a deep tissue massage, and a pedicure. My practitioner pretended she didn't speak English, though I heard her in the hall speaking English just fine. First off - there was no sheet on my massage table. I had less than a tea towel to cover myself with - so I started off with it on my rear end. Uncomfortable, self-conscious and awkward right from the beginning. Throughout the massage, my practitioner's techniques bordered on sexual assault - and I'm really not exaggerating here. I was so flabbergasted and uncomfortable. Massaging my legs (front and back) she moved my knees apart, climbed on the table and straddled my thigh. Her fingertips extended to places they don't belong and when giving me a glute massage, her movement were such that my butt cheeks spread apart, made even more awkward by the fact I had no coverings. Massaging my shoulders, she gave me a full-on breast massage with no covering or any sort of decency. She leaned so far forward, her breasts ended up on my face and her fingers again extended to places they don't belong. The entire time, not a word spoken. The pedicure was great but when I went to pay, I gave a cash tip and paid by debit card. The guy at the counter said I didn't tip and as I was thrown for a total loop by that point, I tipped again. As soon as I left I realized two things: I can't believe I just paid for a service that was so overtly inappropriate from the second I walked in, and I also realized the guy at the counter had slid my cash tip into a desk drawer. I haven't a clue why I didn't say something or stop the treatment, especially after just completing a three year massage therapy program. 8 years later, the thought of the service I had here makes me sick to my stomach."]},

After being with Kaiser (which is a complete joke when it comes to healthcare) it is refreshing to find Dr. Singh who actually looks and listens to you as a patient.

I have been suffering with something no one could seem to figure out and Kaisers best answers were to put everyone on an anti-depressant. \u00a0They only care about your payments, not your health. With Dr. Singh I feel that he is really trying to help me find out what my issues are and the best route to treat me. He is very knowledgeable and well connected with the specialists in the area. I am so glad to have found him and I look forward to a long relationship with him. The office staff is very helpful and very friendly (and I hear they enjoy a blizzard treat on occasion).

My wife fortunately found this office online as we were looking for a medical doctor within the Rancho Cucamonga or surrounding area. I have suffered from migraine headaches for nearly 15 years of my life and I do feel that Dr. Singh and his staff have worked to provide both care and service at a high level. I had visited at least 5 doctors within the Rancho Cucamonga area and I finally found a home after visiting this office. One thing that I think we can all agree on is that no one likes taking time out of their day especially when you have to leave work in order to visit the doctors office. This organization respect your time and when you do check in you can usually count on seeing your doctor within a reasonable timeframe. On the other hand one of my biggest issues with other doctors within Rancho Cucamonga is that I would wait up to an hour after checking in at the front desk. If you're truly looking for a professional to take care of both you and your family then make sure and visit Rancho Wellness. You'll be happy that you did."]},

I had never done anything like this before and I wondered what I had gotten mysdelf into but I am thankful for the staff and trainers that took the time to talk to me and help me. The trainers are always motivating and encouraging you to push yourself just a little bit harder everyday. Every workout was different but I quickly started to feel and see results. I have more energy, I felt stronger and I was losing inches! My work days are long and I have a long commute to and from work. Before the challenge I would get home exhausted, ready to go to bed. Now I get home, go workout and I have energy to do things I need to do. Best part is I'm sleeping better I wake up feeling rested and ready to begin a new day. I am grateful for The Camp Transformation Center Fontana. I am also so very grateful for my family, friends,and co-workers that have been so supportive and encouraging throughout this process.

This being my first time getting a foot massage, I had cluelessly decided to wear skinny jeans to my appointment, but I guess that sort of thing happens pretty regularly because without skipping a beat my masseuse whisks me away to a back laundry area and produces a pair of loose fitting capri pants to wear. So now we're finally ready for the massage part lol this lady was a miracle worker! I wish I had caught her name, but she was a godsend. All in all I think she found about 3-4 tension knots in my feet and calves alone and she made sure to pay special attention to those areas to work out the kinks. After the glorious first 50 minutes were done, I followed her into the body massage room and crawled under the covers onto a heated bed and she went right to work. Perfect amount of pressure, didn't talk much, and I'm pretty sure I passed out at one point which is basically the best compliment I can give a massage lol 10/10 best massage experience I've ever had, including expensive ($300+) massages at fancy hotels, and I plan on returning this weekend for some more r&r.

Each time I went I've experienced outstanding service and massages. So I went there yesterday expecting the same and was greatly dissatisfied. When I walked in I immediately noticed that room was really stuffy and it smelled like old boiled cabbage from someones lunch earlier in the day. I also noticed a bunch of home made signs stating that \"they are no longer affiliated with the Riverside location.\" I was like ok, whatever. In retrospect I feel like the management is now different. Maybe that is their way of stating that? Not sure. \u00a0I ordered the 90 minute foot massage. The masseur \u00a0kept taking loudly to the other therapist \u00a0in a foreign language for the first 20 minutes of my massage. At one point, I heard him giggle. He would stop rubbing to finish his conversation. How annoying is that? \u00a0I did not come to here to hear \u00a0him talk and ramble on, my neck hurts. Also, there was a huge language barrier. He couldn't \u00a0understand what I was saying to him which also made the massage less enjoyable. I had to point and make hand gestures. Overall, once he stopped talking and got the pressure right it really was a great massage. I am member of \u00a0Message Envy but I like coming here for convenience and they really know how to give deep pressure. I have referred many people here as well. It's no frills but typically they do great work. I will continue to come here if conditions improve. Out of all the massages I've had here, he was the only one to talk during it. \u00a0Overall, great \u00a0massage minus the talking."]},

Also they share questions and concerns.. Or simply just encouragement and great recipes to follow!!!

They kept pushing me every time I was ready to quit my set or repetitions. Veterans been there and done that so they know what your capable off. Not only do you get to see your self grow stronger but you get to see the same people from orientation grow too. I saw it as more encouragement! The nutrition plan was great. Not once did I feel like I was starving my self. Over all I do NOT regret this experience and I will DEFINITELY recommend this to all my family and friends. Not only do I feel thinner, I feel HEALTHY! I feel like I just added 10 more years to my life. This is now my life style and I can't wait to continue my journey. Thank you to ALL STAFF MEMBERS!

I was nervous in the beginning not knowing what to expect and excited to begin a healthy lifestyle. I have a membership at a gym and had a trainer, hoping to lose weight which I lost a little, but put it back on. I have tried lots of diet plans lost weight but just put it back on. \u00a0At the camp I learned that eating healthy and working out is a lifestyle not a quick fix losing weight. I decided to start my workout at 6 am in Fontana, up by 5 am was a challenge in itself in the beginning, but I was determined to do this. OMG the 1st week my body was sore I could barely move without feeling the pain. By the 2nd week it became a habit and I looked forward to working out, made sure my workout clothes were ready the night before helped prepare for my busy day ahead. All the trainers are amazing they inspire and encourage us to push hard. By the 3rd week family and friends that hadn't seen me for a while were amazed at the weight loss. It was very encouraging for me to continue it gave me a purpose. This program is so simple to follow but not easy, I had days that I struggled with the diet but got back on track and the results were amazing. The last week of my challenge ended with an injury, I fell at the camp at a workout station and cut my knee pretty bad, ended up with 12 stitches. When I fell everyone came to help me. I realized that I didn't just join a boot camp, I joined a group of people who have the same purpose as I do, who care about each other success! I couldn't be happier to have invested money into my health and new lifestyle with new friends. I want to thank all the trainers at Fontana location and to Daniella Vela for all the support and encouragement that you've given to ensure my success. Once I recover I will have a membership and continue my new lifestyle journey with The Camp Transformation. \u00a0If you are thinking about joining this awesome new lifestyle you will not regret it. This program is awesome, the amazing trainers that push you, believe in you, inspire and motivate you until you believe in yourselves. I would encourage anyone who has tried a weight loss program to believe in this process and give it a try."]},

Those 6 weeks were not easy, but I can honestly say totally worth it. People say it is a rip off, it's inky a rip off If you rip yourself off by not doing what you have to do 110%! The staff are great, approachable and encouraging! The workouts are awesome and everyday is a surprise. I don't thing the last 6 weeks I have had to do the same music. The first week I felt so weak and out of breath, in 6 weeks I have all the energy in the world and feel like I just added years to my life. They give you all the tools you need, there's no guessing. They add you to a secret support group and I have to say it is so helpful. The Asst. Director Mike Perez is awesome! Tim Kipfer and Coach Brian always have encouraging words and really get you pumped! Mike takes the time out to know everyone of us and shows interest in your achievements. If you go in with a poor attitude, you will get a poor result. I lost 21.5 lbs in 6 weeks! Something I thought was unheard of! People say it's a sham cu. you'll just gain it back, but you that is when you have to make a choice if you want to be healthier and happier as opposed to doing what got you there in the first place. I can say I am addicted. Had no intention of becoming a member, but after I saw and felt the results, that's just what I did!!"]},

Dr. Huang diagnosed me upon my first visit, created a treatment plan specific to my needs, and now after 10 sessions, I can actually lift my arms and move them freely with no pain what so ever. I was amazed at how fast I was healing. The thing I love about Dr. Huang is that she has your best interests at heart. She cares about her patients' healing process. Her prices are super cheap compared to other chiropractors/acupuncturists. Her skill, knowledge, and experience is unmatched. Dr. Huang also gives you strengthening exercises and stretches to help you heal quicker. Having experience with well over 10 different practices, I must say she is the only doctor I've met who gives you the resources/knowledge you need to speed up your healing process.

I saw Dr Tai and he gave me an acupuncture session, honored my request of no medication, and had his assistant massage my head. I felt so much better after the session. My headache was gone immediately though my glands were still swollen and my throat still hurt. He gave me some herbal cream to put on my neck.

Again, no oral medication per my request. I asked him for food recommendations and he willingly told me and even wrote them down for me. Unlike other Chinese medicine doctors I've seen. They usually just want you to buy their herbal medicines (probably the main way they make money) instead of telling you what food you can eat on a regular basis. I was supposed to soak my feet in the medicine for 30 days, but I had to leave town, so I only did it for 5 days. My knees are perfectly fine after the 5 days though. It just works!! It's been two weeks and they haven't bothered me since.

He respects the fact I don't want to take oral medicines and tried to think of ways to help me that he can't make money of.

It is amazing that my first session with Evo. Therapy cured my pain. I was very surprised to hear the therapist saying to me, go and play soccer again, just after the first hour. And I did go to play soccer and the pain was gone. Very impressive!", "Their well-working theory was to find the root cause of the knee tendon pain and adjust my muscle and align my two legs first.

I made a stop to The Camp transformation to pick up an app I was welcomed right in by Mike. I sat in the office as he explained to me in detail how this challenge worked. Towards the end I found myself looking for excuses again I shook my head and snapped out of it quickly and signed up right there and then for the 6 week challenge. Best part about it I wasn't pressured at all nor did I feel forced to sign anything because no one likes to be force to sign a contract wouldn't you agree? Mike was really polite and helped me see reality and what was best for me. Thank you Mike for that. Had orientation a few days later where workouts, diet plan and everything else was discuss in detail n very clear by The Boss Xavier and Manager Danielle. Met the trainers Tim ,Jr , Ken and Mike they seem great. We were able to ask all question we had without being shy you get this comfort level there like as if you are meant to be there. When I arrived to the gym for my 1st workout Cynthia and Danielle greeted me with a smile and made me feel welcomed right away. When I went into the actual gym it was nice and clean which is important to me then I met \u00a0trainer Ken and Jr they are both fun and filled with lots of energy which I enjoyed they had all sections ready which they did explained clearly and were always there to guide me thru out my workout. First week was though but after completing my challenge with a total weight loss of 25.6 my body now craves the work outs and healthy foods I don't ever see myself going back to my old bad habits. Thx to my trainers there all awesome in their own kind of way Tim, Jr, Ken and Mike and also the challengers and members for always pushing and guiding me and for playing all the awesome beats that made my workouts even more entertaining. I feel as if I accomplished something big but the real challenge is now. Therefore I've become a member because there is no way I will be 167 lbs again and I must face it I just love going to where I belong which is The Camp Transformation Fontana, it's part of me now and I must say I LOVE THE NEW ME."]},

I had a question about what if I wanted to do it for 6 weeks? She responded that you look like you need to lose more than 20 pounds and I'm not willing to work with people who don't want to help themselves. These people should not be very rude to the customers and we should have a choice of how much we want to do and if we want to only do 6 weeks. They're very manipulative and make you post nice things about them to Facebook and other social media they require you to have.

The massages are hard though, so if you're a lightweight, you need to let them know before they start and remind them along the way, they sometimes forget. Apparently the harder the better. The body massage depends on the person giving it, I had Jackie and he was great! He starts off warming up the body by massaging through a bedsheet, then goes in deeper to the muscles using oil. I must admit massaging through a bedsheet is a little strange, but it works.

I would say that I prefer a firmer pressured massage and the RMT's mentioned previously definitely will give that to you if you want. I'm sure they do softer massages too if you request it. Sue seems to always be able to tell where I will be sore and how to massage the knots out of my muscles. If it's one of my problem areas in my right shoulder, she asks \"Is it really sore?\" to make sure she doesn't give me too much pressure there. :) Very considerate. And, I think she goes above and beyond what other RMT's have done for me by massaging my pecs and my armpit, which are muscle groups linked to the sore ones in my shoulder. Who knew they were all connected? although it's a lil bit embarrassing to have someone pressing into my armpit, I have to say that this is what makes my painful shoulder feel so much better afterwards. I would credit weekly massage sessions with Sue for what has helped me live almost pain-free from an old injury in my right shoulder.

I visited the website, called and made an appointment (September 2011).", "At that time, my rashes were making me so miserable; I even had to send a friend to take my sister to a concert because I couldn't take her myself as I was in extreme discomfort and my body itchiness became intense. I first saw Dr. Georgia Kyba. In my first appointment (November 2011), I told her about my problems and showed her my rashes. After she had a look, I asked one simple question: \"Dr. Kyba, can you help me?\" She answered with absolute confidence \"Yes!\"", "Over the next few weeks that followed the initial appointment, I got my adrenals tested and took an allergy food test (involving having some blood taken out - OUCH!) and waited for the results. In the meantime, Dr. Kyba gave me a bottle of natural antihistamines plus a homeopathic ointment for my comfort. ", "A little more than two weeks later, the results came in: my adrenals were fine but my blood allergy test found I developed a sensitivity to meat-protein and gluten (found in wheat, barley and rye). She put me on a gluten-free and vegan (no meat, fish, chicken, dairy or eggs); in that moment when I found out about my sensitivity, I gave up meat and wheat cold turkey!!! That same appointment, she presented me with a meal plan she typed up herself! She also added more naturopath medications that will help me and a brown rice-based protein supplement I would take in form of a smoothie every morning that had ingredients that will take down the inflammation and repair my system. She also had me adding flax to my diet as well and instructed me to eat leafy greens every single day.", "Over the next six months, I stuck to my gluten-free and vegan diet. As a girl who loves burgers and pizzas plus fried chicken, it was hard! I roasted the Christmas turkey over the holidays and could not eat any of it! I had gluten-free oatmeal for breakfast every morning. I do field sales work for Superstores throughout the Lower Mainland; people carting by me with deli chicken in the carts drove me batty. But I wanted to get well and stuck with it.", "I also continuously returned to see Dr. Kyba so she can monitor my progress. She allowed me to have lamb once a month since I was moderately sensitive to it. My gluten-free/vegan diet has motivated me to cook lots of Indian-inspired dishes at home (particularly Curried Lentils with Potatoes - YUM!).", "It's been six months and my skin has improved so much. At the end of summer last year, my back was inflamed: red and covered with welts. My back has cleared up as did my legs and torso. As Dr. Kyba went on a leave of absence in March 2012, Dr. Agnieszka Matusik took over to help me complete the course of my treatment. Dr. Matusik is now guiding me on slowly incorporating meat back into my diet and finishing the latter stages of \"repairing your gut\" (that was the exact way she put it).", "I am very happy to say that the doctors at Burnaby Integrative has changed my life for the better and I wholeheartedly recommend them if you have an allergy issue or other health woes (insomnia, PMS, menopause...that is a partial list).

For anyone to claim that it's not possible or in a patients head/imagination should have their license reviewed and removed from caring for patients!!!

It always seemed a bit sketchy that upon check-in, the receptionist would require electronic signatures for what is explained to be consent forms and you have to specifically ask them to flip their monitor around if you don't want to sign blindly. Around 3 years ago, I was transferred to a different dentist within the same office, though I had been satisfied with the one I had been seeing. The \"new\" dentist seemed very uncertain and/or not confident in reading my x-rays and told me she thought I \"may have a cavity\", therefore her solution was to go ahead and do a filling. Not very comforting to know she may have been too inexperienced to know what she was looking at and potentially drilled into a healthy tooth. With that, I found a different dentist near my job site and went there for several years. ", "Recently, I decided to give Sierra Lakes another try to keep my appointments close to home. I called and made an appointment, specifying that it was for a bi-annual cleaning. Upon checking in, the receptionist wanted me to sign a consent form for x-rays, but I told her I just had some at my last cleaning. She said they do them every 6 months, but again I told her I was not going to do them because I knew my insurance only covered x-rays once a year. She then checked my policy and verified exactly what I told her. I don't recall ever having a dental office not verify coverage before attempting to arrange a service like that.", "I was soon escorted to an exam room and my original dentist came in. He literally spent less than a minute looking inside my mouth and said everything appeared to be ok. Then a billing clerk came in, bring an itemized bill for a special (deeper) cleaning, which exceeded my coverage and required a $78 co-payment. She said there happened to be a cancellation that afternoon, therefore they could fit me into the schedule and do it right then. I told her that my appointment was actually for a cleaning and she replied it was only made for an exam. I would have never wasted my time in driving over there just for a visual exam!", "I asked why I couldn't have a regular (covered) cleaning. She said that since I had a deeper cleaning 2.5 years ago, it automatically put me in a different customer category and all future cleanings would be deeper. This didn't make any sense to me considering the dentist never mentioned the necessity of a deeper cleaning and I had 5 or so regular cleanings from another dentist's office since my last visit. I was so utterly frustrated at that point, I refused any other services or to schedule my next appointment and just left. What a waste of time! It'll be interesting to see if they end up billing my insurance company for stuff I refused to have done....SHADY!"]},

I felt bad but finally asked for a new person which then she came back and said there was no one else available so she asked if she could massage my boyfriend instead and have my boyfriend's masseuse massage me and my boyfriend said yes. The entire time, they were also trying to upsell their services for extended massage time, and to buy future packages. They were relentless! DO NOT COME HERE!

It was plain water. Then after 15 mins we had a chance to ask and they didn't understand what we were asking. Finally they realized and instead of giving us fresh water, they just dumped the crystals in our cold water and left us for another 15 mins. The crystals did not activate because they used the old cold water. What a waste of another 15 mins. After my massage from Sleep, he then asked \"shoulder massage?\" And I asked if it was included. He didn't understand my response. Finally the other guy doing my friend said that it would be an extra charge. I thought maybe he was offering to do my shoulders as an apology for falling asleep. On top of all that the customer service was nil. No welcome in the door, no names, loud talkers coming and going, water given in styrofoam cups, no question about the pressure.

There wasn't any good lighting for her to see my tiny skin tags, and she skipped like one third of them cause she didn't see them in a dark room. She took a container with liquid nitrogen and asked me to open it, because her hands were holding something else and she didn't have where to put those things because, once again, there were no instruments nor any surface (except from a computer desk) for her to put things down. I tried to open the container, but I did something wrong (because, you know, I'm not an expert!) and the pressure started hissing and she yelled \"no, not there!\". Then she threw away the things she was holding on the dirty desk, and opened it by her self. Then she used the same dirty instruments to start burning my skin tags down. With her dirty hands. With no surgical gloves. With no clean instruments. But that's still not the worst part.", "The smallest skin tags had to be removed with scissors, so she told me there's gonna be some bleeding. When my neck obviously started doing just that - to bleed, she realized she had no gauze (!) and she run to get some and came back with a tiny piece of it. She cleaned some blood, put some cream on my neck, LAUGHED at me and said, I swear to god: \"Hahaha! IT LOOKS LIKE A CRIME SCENE!\" And then, again I swear, she left the room, leaving me there, my neck and chest covered in blood, wondering if I'm done, should I leave, will she come back? She didn't say goodbye, she didn't tell me the treatment is over. ", "I went to the reception desk, and two ladies sitting there couldn't hide they horrifies looks when they saw me. They looked disgusted and asked me if I'm all right and if I need some help. I said that the doctor obviously thinks I'm good, and that I just wanted to pay and leave. The people at the waiting room looked at me, grossed out as well. Everyone's face was grimacing while looking at me. I couldn't even wear my jacket because of how bloody and greasy my upper body was.

In addition, the dentist said my daughter had 3 cavities. So I asked the dentist to show me. After looking in my daughter's mouth, there were no cavities at all. The dentist showed me some \"calcification\" on the side of her tooth. No holes at all in her teeth. They wanted nearly $400 from my pocket that would have been much more after the insurance refused payment on coating they didn't even need. We walked out after wasting time getting X-rays that I was never shown. So to cover myself, this review will confirm that my kids received no treatment, and I had better not receive any bill in the mail since I confirmed this twice with the assistant, and billing girl at the counter.

The dentist was the same as her assistant very nice she made sure she asked if I had any concerns or questions. She was very patient and also help put me at ease since I do get nervous at the dentists. In fact their patient questionnaire that is one of the questions. I had to get a deep cleaning and the hygienist was like everyone else very nice. She is very personable and friendly, most important she was very gentle. This was the first time I didn't leave sore and felt like I got kicked. Also had to get fitted for a mouth guard and again the assistant was very friendly and a happy person.

He recommended a regimen and said it would help to come 3 times a week if possible to see if I could nip it in the butt.

I was very pleased and decided to book moreappointments for the next few weeks for 3 times a week. I spent 6 weeks in treatment with the same treatments every time and really started to notice a difference in my ability to walk long distances without pain and I needed less and less foot massages and at-home icing. After 6 weeks of intensive treatment I feel as though most of my pain is gone and I can manage it to make sure it doesn't come back through simple stretches, icing and massaging.

We were lead downstairs to a lounge where there was juice, coffee, teas and chaise lounge chairs in a dimly lit room which was meant to be relaxing but felt.....old as the hotel has been there for sometime. We were then asked to come upstairs to do our manicures however it was on top floor which was 3 flights of stairs up which they don't mention to you over the phone when you book. I am unfortunately not in shape so getting up the stairs was a bit of a challenge and would be for anyone with knee issues or that is of an elderly age. Once we were upstairs, we were seated to do our mani's but there are no side by side tables and everything feels kinda cramped. All is all the $100 for a gel manicure (tax&tip) was NOT worth it especially since I couldn't sit beside my friend and chat and that is part of the fun when you are doing that with a friend, its supposed to be an experience not a chore. I wouldn't return. The only plus was really the light chicken salad that was offered which we didn't partake in as we were going out for lunch before shopping. And for that price it should be caviar, not chicken."]},

Even though I just had a dental cleaning 3 months ago (in a different city), I decided since we switched jobs and insurance, I'd go in for a cleaning. It's free, why not? My teeth were fine 3 months ago. I even compared the xrays -- nothing has changed. However, upon going today, I now all of the sudden have $6k worth of work needed. Specifically, they felt I needed veneers on my front since I have one tooth that is slightly discolored (it's been slightly discolored since as long as I can remember -- they're the first to ever comment, let alone think I need $2k+ in work to fix a nonissue). When I told them I'd pass, they looked surprised. Then they felt I needed to have a deep cleaning (under the gums), even though I just had one 3 months ago. Apparently when you have the typical 6 month cleaning here, they don't really do much of anything. She reminded me they just polish your teeth. In every dentist I've been to, they scrape away at the plaque at a general cleaning, not just polish. Here, you have to do additional work that's not included in a standard insurance plan. Of course, I'm new to CA so that may be a CA thing, but never heard of that. I expected to have my teeth cleaned if I was going in for a cleaning. Odd. The best part was that I had the xrays (which are VERY thorough) and exam with the dentist, the hygienist found a teeny tiny cavity and brought the dentist and now all of the sudden, now I need more work, when 10 min ago, she looked in that exact spot and told me it looked great. My favorite dentist (in another city) told me that when looking for a dentist, beware...if they talk money before anything else, go elsewhere. I'd say this is one of those places. Before I even had the polish done, they had someone come in to talk about my treatment plan and how much it all costs. I miss my old dentist that would thoroughly clean your teeth, then exam them, THEN tell you if there's any concern -- rather than jump right into how much you need to pay. Oh, one last thing. They jump right on the most expensive options and down play the cheaper options. It's definitely more of a cosmetic-minded dentist than one that's just looking out for the health of your mouth."]},

The room was dark blue (I think) with a heated spa bed on each side and I could hear some relaxing music in the back ground.

I wasn't expecting much from this place, I just hope I will leave the shop soft and smooth. The scrub was abit awkward but I think that's how it is. It is something I felt I could do it myself but I'm paying someone do it for me. I sat up, she scrubs my back, I put my knees up, she scrubs my legs, etc. It didn't take long to do. After that, she applied some warm mud on my body with a brush. It felt pretty nice but the \"mud\" was not brown. It was clear. Have you seen clear mud before? Anyways it didn't really bug me but I was abit disappointed. Then she wrapped me up with plastic and towels. She left and was gone for awhile. I tried to relax and fell asleep a few times. I think she didn't return until 15-30mins later. I was looking forward to some facial and it was definitely relaxing. I could tell that she had training for this and it felt great. Too bad that there was no extraction involved; I had blackheads. She also gave me a head massage which was a bonus. The best part was the facial. I think that part took the most time. When the time was up, I was told to stand up so she can remove the plastic and some towels. She left me with a medium sized towel and advised me to leave the room and go take a shower. I was kinda worried because what if there are people around the waiting area and/or hallway. Good thing that there was no one. I took a shower and rinsed off in a small enclosement. After I was washed off, I felt kinda nice but my body didn't feel any smoother than before, unfortunately. I don't think I would pay reg price at $175 for this.

I decided to leave massage envy which I was a member a couple years.. Had my first massage here in December wasn't bad and it wasn't super great. Place was nice very relaxing and close to home and prices were right. I was waiting for my health care spending account to kick in so the front desk told me I can come in Jan and they would honor pricing. Came back in Jan spoke to a different front desk lady who barely knew anything..they claimed they didn't tell me they would honor pricing from December because it was corporate who raised their prices..So I'm like whatever I just decided to do a 6 month membership instead of 12 mos because I was getting skeptical about this place. So my first massage as a member was disgusting it was a male asian therapist he was strong did deep tissue very well BUT he was sweating on me. Laying on my chest I should not feel someone's sweat drops landing on my bare back. I felt disgusted could no longer relax I told him to please take a break wipe himself off but even after that his hands continued to feel wet and sweaty mixed with massage lotion. After the massage I expressed my concern with the front desk she apologized for my experience and gave me a hot stone upgrade for my next massage. So today I called requested an appointment with a female who specializes in DEEP tissue. The lady that massaged me tonite she was super sweet and friendly BUT not strong at all and clearly did not specialize in DEEP. She did ask me about the pressure and I did ask for more but she only kept it for about 5 seconds. She was basically just rubbing my skin. So this time when I expressed my concern with the receptionist I didn't get any world class customer service that I see massage green commenting on other reviews saying this is what they provide ..no..she seemed as if she was frustrated of me telling her my experience. There was no empathy in her voice whatsoever. Didn't offer anything this time. After I asked how do u know if these masseuses really specialize in Deep tissue. She suggested I try Merci or Charlene. So pretty much I just wasted a paid massage just throwing my money away experimenting with this business. Since I paid for a 6 mos membership no refunds I made an appointment with Charlene. We shall see how that goes. I'm starting to think I should start looking for another place that specializes in Deep tissue THERAPEUTIC massages. Because I don't think this is it."]},

SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY. The whole time my honest thought was \"I shouldve just paid the extra money\" I dont remember the name of the Lady that did it for me, maybe Kim? anyway, to start I walked in and still had to wait even though I had an appt, I wasnt greeted, I was treated and \"rung up\" as if I was at walmart, Receipt was printed on a regular printer.... just very unprofessional. When I went into the room there was cardboard covering the windows and you could hear the cars zooming past (since on the side of the road). My therapist came in and never asked for my name. Her hands were super scratchy and she had what sounded like a horrible cold. I had specifically asked for someone who could do deep/sports massage, and when I asked her to put a little bit more pressure (she never asked how the pressure was) she then proceeded to inform me that she wasnt capable of doing too deep due to her wrist... (WHY WOULD YOU SCHEDULE ME WITH HER?) Anyways, I walked out without saying a word. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. HORRIBLE PLACE. not worth it. I actually ended up getting my membership through Massage heights again today and im beyond excited! I love it there!"]},

The young girl was nice and extremely polite so I just dealt with it. I did not want her to get in trouble I don't like to \"drive the bus\" over people. She said our time is almost up and the only body part she covered was essentially my upper back and it felt like either rubbing lotion on my back or single fingers just pushing one at a time not even deep enough and other times I couldn't feel a thing.

Jacky was able to quickly pinpoint what was going on and worked on my leg to get me some immediate relief followed by ice therapy. It was painful, but but it was what I needed! Jacky even shared his notes electronically with my chiro back home so that she could continue my treatment seamlessly.

That's exactly how convenient this clinic is in its service offerings. They've got everything from RMT, chiro, acupuncture, naturopathy, and more! After 7 appointments of various treatments, I've gotten to know almost half the team fairly quickly, and all I can say is - this team is solid.", "Massages:", "I had both Gillian (aka. Gill, pronounced \"Jill\" for those of you who don't want to walk in as confused as I was), and Cassandra.", "Gill was great - no doubt given her multidisciplinary background! Great personality, easy to talk to, and skilled in her art. She had no trouble working out my knots, and applied just the right amount of force. Her movements spoke confidence. If you need someone who's plenty experienced in the field, Gill's your girl. Just do me a favour and pronounce her name as \"grill\" without the \"r\", or \"gill\" as in \"fish gill\" (sorry Gill :P)", "As for Cassandra, she's one of the new additions to the team. My first appointment with her was when she was only 3 weeks in. Despite that, was I impressed! Awesome and fun personality, super easy to click with, and very knowledgeable. Her trigger point therapy is on fleek! I could actually feel the difference as she's treating me. She also conducts herself very professionally, asks all the necessary and right questions from the start. If you need a RMT, I highly recommend Cassandra. I actually recommended a colleague of mine to her, and he told me Cassandra's treatment was exactly the type of massage he was looking for, and that Cassandra is now [verbatim] his benchmark for any massages he'll receive from anyone else. ", "Chiro:", "I had Kelly as my chiropractor. Mind you, it was my first time getting this type of treatment so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect other than getting my joints cracked and some tension released. My expectations were met, but she delivered beyond that. After analyzing me, Kelly was able to (very quickly) determine which areas of my body needed work and where the focus of the treatments should be. She was able to point out and explain all my flaws (thanks) to me very easily, which for the weak-minded - take caution! There's no fluff with this girl, and I like it - straight to the point! The only thing that took a hit was my ego, but that's ok. When she's doing her thing, I have to say, I almost like it as much as I like massages - it felt great! After each subsequent treatment, she would follow up with teaching me exercises that would benefit me. All-in-all, very professional - oh, and great personality as well!", "Naturopath:", "Dr. Julie is now going to be officially my second doctor. Like chiro, I didn't know what to expect given it was my first experience, but after getting a sense for what naturopath has to offer, I wished I had known about this field years ago! I can't say how her treatments have faired so far given I just started, but what I can say is that Julie is definitely knowledgeable, and empathic. If you've got insurance that covers naturopath - or don't mind the cost - I highly recommend giving this field a try. It's always good to have alternative options!", "Support Team:", "Or otherwise most commonly referred to as the receptionists to most people I believe (even though their actual titles would indicate they do a lot more than that!), Trishna and Taveena has the place kept spot clean, appointments organized, and overall operations running smooth. I usually see Taveena whenever I walk in, and she always offers me water or tea. I think a great initial impression matters, and these girls deliver. Additional details, they can claim your insurance directly if supported, and invoices emailed to you. Pure convenience. ", "Apart from everything already said, I'm just glad I finally found a place that offers the level of service that I expect. After all of these appointments, I felt like a marshmallow.

The way it works is that you call and make an appointment with a doctor who will them determine the next course of action, whether it's massage, athletic therapy, physical therapy etc., all of which is provided on-site.", "To make a very long story short, I ended up seeing three different doctors over the span of about eight months, who gave me different diagnoses and never actually bothered to touch my body to feel WTF was going wrong. I know touch isn't always necessary to determine the source of problems, but in this case I could literally feel my joints moving around in my back and in my knee, but nobody listened. The end result of that approach only ended up making my problems worse.", "Under the alternating supervision of those doctors, I was assigned to an athletic therapist, then without warning switched to a different athletic therapist, and then finally switched to a physiotherapist. The athletic therapists (and to a lesser extent the PT) were friendly and competent, but ultimately useless as they were following the doctors' instructions which were based on a fundamentally wrong understanding of the problem. In fact, as I later found out when I finally gave in and went to a private clinic, all the adjustments, massages and rehab exercises they had me doing for those eight months were the exact *opposite* of what I should have been doing: the doctors at the clinic assumed I had some kind of arthritis (even though the blood tests came back negative), and all the stretching and muscle lengthening exercises only exacerbated the actual problem of having two hypermobile joints in my lower back that needed to be strengthened, not relaxed. I believe that if anyone had actually listened to my concerns and bothered to rest their hand on my lower back for just a few seconds I wouldn't have spent eight months essentially sabotaging my recovery. And, I suspect that had I been a varsity athlete I, and my symptoms, would have been taken a lot more seriously and received a different level of care.", "I also found the administrative setup there to be needlessly inefficient. For example, during the course of my treatment there I developed tendonitis in my wrists and arms, which to me was pretty clearly caused by some of the rehab exercises they had me do. But, because that's a different part of the body and not what my original complaint was, I had to see yet another doctor to get that taken care of, a doctor who didn't really have any clue about the kind of treatment I was already receiving.

The entire session was devoted to establishing a baseline and a sense of whether or not the techniques used by Yuji and Stephanie would work for my rehabilitation.", "I proceeded on an 8 session journey over the course of 4 weeks. Each session progress was made. Don't get me wrong, I had homework after every session and doing this work on my own time was very important in ensuring continued successes after each session.", "Did I find the holy grail of stretching techniques (hint: no such thing) that would help me reach my goal of being able to do a complete and proper squat ... No... But do I have the tools to get there now... Absolutely yes!!!", "I highly recommend this duo for all your stretching and physiotherapy (PT) needs. Where conventional PT fails they may very well be the breakthrough your body needs in achieving its rehabilitation needs."]},

I appreciated that she brought me the wifi password, although it could have been because I had asked if they had wifi prior to agreeing to the service.

It was only my second foot massage, but it was not as good as my first. I kept on asking the masseuse to use firmer pressure (go harder), but it did not seem to make any difference in what he was doing. The massage itself probably lasted around 35 minutes, so I was in and out in about 45 minutes. At the end, my feet and legs were a greasy mess, so I asked the lady if I could soak them again. For some reason she said that I couldn't, but offered me a warm wet towel instead. I took her up on this and she wiped down my legs for me. It was only when I was leaving that I was offered water or tea. This was a bit odd to me as I would have liked to enjoy those during the actual massage.", "Given that there are so many other similar places in Chinatown that offer the 60 minute foot massages for $30, I will try another option before returning to Zhen Zhen."]},

The space they had was nice and the massage rooms were roomy and clean. The foot massage was fabulous! It was only 30 minutes though, and since my friend had a blister on her foot she didn't want the soak, but I did so that was cut short for me as well about 5 min was all I got. I got the full 30 min body massage but they had to call in a different girl for that since one of the girls \"regulars\" came in but that was OK and my body massage was really good. \u00a0I think she actually got my back to crack. I'm only deducting one star for the fact I was in there a little over an hour and the deal should have been an hour and a half. \u00a0They had tried to up sell by telling us about getting a longer body massage if our backs were hurting that would be better so I kinda thought when we went in for the body part they would make up the 15 min. \u00a0But that didn't happen my lady was done right on 30 min. \u00a0But over all it was a good deal. Perhaps if you come here just get the foot massage it is fabulous and you wont lose any time if they are only doing that for you.

I have no idea how crucial your feet are to everyday activities, until they are 'out of service'.

They articulate and present the reasoning for the course of care they suggest and that's it. Dr. Kelly is knowledgeable and has a calm demeanour about him. Dr. Oseen is smart and exceptionally sweet. They both have provided me with thorough care regarding a neck that needs to curve more (too many years trying to stand super upright & straight) and a knee that needs to be more steadfast for longer runs (too much frigid shinny on chippy outdoor ice). Dr. Kelly's investment in his patent's health extends to the studio he's built adjacent to the office, which houses yoga and TRX sessions for clients to partake in; real estate is not cheap in overpriced Black Gold County, so you know his compassion trumps his pocket book. Being a huge architecture fan, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the amazing post modern rendition of the building itself (to think it was an old 7-11 years back).

The process, while still slow (come on, it's an emergency room) tends to take about half the time of a real hospital, the nursing staff (with one or two notable exceptions - and trust me on the one or two, I worked there for a couple months, I know most of them BY NAME lol) are much more approachable and friendly, and due to it's relatively new presence, it's not nearly as busy... in fact, I've found people who live and/or work within blocks of this place, and don't even know it exists.", "A perfect example was a few months ago when I injured my elbow.

I had called there to book an appointment with her but they informed me she no longer worked there. So what did I do next? I googled her, and found her here at Nose Creek Sports Physical therapy! Rebecca's technique is unparalleled; she has almost a sixth sense, knowing exactly where your problem areas are and using a magical combination of pressure and technique to relieve the tension in your muscles. What I love about Rebecca is that she really customizes your treatment, from Thai massage to hot stones; she does what she thinks it's necessary to help you. I'm extremely tight in my shoulders and neck, and she had no issue breaking out the heating pad & hot stones, incorporating them into my session to help loosen up my muscles. Don't be shocked either if she gets right up on your massage table digs into those tightly knotted muscles, because she will, making her one of the best massage therapists I have ever had. \u00a0Prices are reasonable, $90 for 60 minutes. Nose Creek Sports Therapy also directs bills your insurance provider if you so wish. \u00a0Don't expect some luxury spa, it's a clinic, but the massage room is neat and tidy. I don't need all the spa amenities, I care about the quality and skill of a masseuse. I raved about Rebecca when she worked at a fancy spa, I still rave about her now that she works here at this sports therapy clinic. I'm so glad I tracked her down and found her here, I'll be a regular for as long as Rebecca works there. \u00a0Also the clinic has no tip function on their debit/credit terminal, so if you wish to leave Rebecca a tip, please bring cash. She doesn't post it anywhere that it's cash only for tips because she doesn't want anyone to feel obligated, but I believe tipping is a reflection of exemplary service which she provides every time!"]},

Usually after a massage, the therapist offers you a glass of water. Right after my massage was over, the girl left and I never saw her again.

I wish i had gone to a real doctor to begin with. I chose them because they have an office near my house and I like supporting local businesses.

They claim that very few of their clients ever have problems with their orthotics, which would be nice, but you better hope you're not one of people who has problems. My first pair of orthotics caused me such excruciating pain in my feet that I felt like they were bruised on the bottoms after only walking in them for about 20 minutes (and I only weigh 115 pounds). After a few adjustments (which took a good week of phone calls to schedule), the orthotics were in no way \"custom\" any more. One didn't even provide any support at all, and I was having horrible ankle pain. They made me a new pair which I tried to gradually start wearing, but after 2 weeks I still couldn't wear them for more than an hour without being in pain. I called them a week and a half ago about them and finally was able to talk to them today (10 days of phone tag, how professional is that?). I have been asking them for my money back because the orthotics are not helping me at all, and now they tell me they don't do refunds. They said I could come in again and have them adjusted again, but I don't want to keep doing that because every time I have gotten them adjusted it has just caused me pain in a new area - feet, ankle, knee, hip. I never should have gone to this company for orthotics. I have real problems with my knee which they obviously cannot fix, and they are refusing to give me my money back so I can go elsewhere. Don't make the same mistake I did! If you have real pain, go to a real doctor."]},

It is so warm (literally - temperature was in the 80s!) and calming, I felt so relaxed and would have stayed there longer.", "This place is a spa, with the focus on hot and cold baths, saunas and steams. They also provide registered massages, so you can pay for a massage and go to the baths before and/or after, or you can just come to use the baths.", "Upon entering, you are given a robe, two towels, slippers and a wristband for your locker, and directed to the locker room. Once there, put on your bathing suit, load up your locker and away you go!", "They strongly suggest showering before going into the pools, and I like knowing that the other clientele showered before sharing the water with me. ", "There is a beautiful large hot bath with waterfalls, and frosted glass on the walls. The water was so loud and the glass frosted enough that it took me a while before I realized this bath was facing the street! The water is warm but not too warm, and there are jets everywhere. Next to it was a small freezing cold pool. The idea is you are supposed to heat up, then plunge into the cold, and then heat up again, doing a circuit through the baths and saunas. I could not bring myself to PLUNGE into that cold water! I went to my knees. It was frigid.", "The saunas were great - hot and pore-opening. There is also a lounge area where you can rest after bathing and also wait for your massage. They had a juice bar and snacks for pay too. i didn't pay much attention to that, however.", "My massage was soothing and the RMT was very professional and polite. I know it's a good massage when I am dazed and drooling throughout, so two thumbs up!!", "This is a nice place to go with your friends and chill out, although they are very strict about the silence policy and we got shushed several times for talking in quieter than normal voices. I wish their \"PDA\" policy was a little stricter, as there was a couple making out hardcore in the lounge area, and they also locked people out of one of the saunas while they were \"getting down\" too. Tacky! Bring it home or get a room.", "Aside from one crude young couple, this place was perfect. I would definitely return when I get a bonus or something, although if your company does insurance refunds for massages, you can add some of your own money to it and it's worth it!"]},

You would think that a place like this (which is marketed as high end) would limit the number of people to enjoy the experience at its full potential, especially since they make you reserve your spots in advance... ", "Anyhow, It was certainly not a great experience for me, mostly because all of the bath areas were small; especially the \"bigger heated pool\" which was packed like sardines. You could also smell the chlorine overload, obviously as their were so may people, it would be unhygienic not to.. Even all the rest areas were full and you had to wait your turn.", "All in all I was very much disappointed by this, I felt there were WAY to many people for a very small space, the place was also messy from so many people going back and forth; it went against the whole \"silence and peace\" vibe that they were trying to create and was definitely not worth the hype or money."]},
