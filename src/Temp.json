I was pregnant at the time and was told that I really shouldn't get the massage but that they would see me in their office and offered a pregnancy safe water chair massage. I was totally fine with that and went in. Well, as another reviewer pointed out, the initial visit takes forever. I was there for at least a hour and a half. No doctor ever looked at my back or examined my spine. I was unable to get X-rays because I was pregnant. However, they came up with a pregnancy treatment plan and asked me to come in 3x a week! I was working full time and in grad school and decided to pass. \u00a0I got many phone calls after the visit trying to schedule a follow up appointment but I was just turned off from their office.", "That isn't my biggest problem with the office. I continue to get letters, sent from Dr Cohen, that he is very concerned about my xrays and is worried about my nervous system and overall health. \u00a0I NEVER GOT XRAYS! \u00a0(I actually just received a letter today, 3 years later!) They are using scare tactics to get people to come in! Chiropractors can be so amazing and helpful-but have a hard enough time defending their profession without an office lying about treatments I need."], "state": ["MD"], "name": "Living Wellness Chiropractic", "category": ["Chiropractors"], "review_stars": ["1.0"]},

During this hour, I had to fill out countless forms (most offices send forms in advance of your appointment, to cut down on wait time). I also had to watch an awful, corny movie from 1990 that told me how Chiropractic works. THEN, I had to read a series of laminated brochures. ", "After an hour, I was taken into an office with a counselor, where she proceeded to ask me a series of questions, most of which I had already answered on the 15 pages of paperwork I had already filled out. Then, she proceeded to quiz me (seriously, I'm not joking) on what I had read in the pamphlets! ", "The counselor asked me if I was ready for my xrays. Xrays? I haven't even seen the doctor yet. No one has felt my spine or examined me, and they already are telling me that I need xrays? I had to pay the full price for the xrays now, up front, and they would reimburse me later based on my insurance plan. (It is now 2 months later, and I am currently after them because they have neither 1. submitted to my insurance company or 2. reimbursed me for any amount. I cannot get anyone at the office to return my calls.)", "THEN, they took me to another area where I waited for the doctor for another 10 minutes. Finally the doctor came in, pressed in a few places, asked me more questions I had already answered, and took my xrays. After that, I waited another 10 minutes to be adjusted by a different doctor.", "A week later, I came back in to review my xrays. AGAIN I had to watch a different movie! And read different pamphlets! And again I had to meet with the counselor, who again quizzed me on the movie and pamphlets! ", "After we reviewed the xrays with the first doctor, they informed me that I would need to come for 60 visits. I would have to sign a contract agreeing to come for all 60 visits, and if I missed one without rescheduling right away, I'd be fined! I would have to come three times a week, no exceptions. The total expense for the 60 visits (even with my insurance's contribution) was over $1500. You had to either pay up front, pay as you went, or set up an auto debit, but you had to sign a contract AGREEING TO PAY FOR 60 VISITS. Is this a doctor's office or a car dealership?", "I left and went to another chiropractor in the area, who told me this place is notorious. Since, I have met several other people who had negative experiences with this practice--some even got into legal disputes over their chiropractic \"contract.\""], "state": ["MD"], "name": "Living Wellness Chiropractic", "category": ["Chiropractors"], "review_stars": ["1.0"]},
