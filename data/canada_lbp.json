Became paralyzed after caudal injection and still not have complete control over both legs. They deny it is from the injection but read up support's agree it is possible that the injection cause such. I am now still without complete function on my legs and that's after 5 month. I went from a functional managing life on my own with very little housecleaning help to a senior who is for the past 5 month 100% depending on everything from showering. dressing and just all to get through my day. \u00a0ADVANCED SPINAL CENTER HAS BEEN MADE AWARE OF MY SITUATION BUT BESIDES DENYING \u00a0THE REFERRED ME BACK TO MY GP who, in return does not even know what to do with me and the condition. I had fairly positive experience there , I have gone there for 2 years and had a good rapport going till I question the facility due to the treatment November 23rd last year when I after, lost use of my legs.So past week on my appointent day I came in with pains 10 plus and hadrly could walk. A assistant tech came in (new) and started to ask me \u00a0 question which had been covered already when starting using the facility 2 years back. Since I hire a driver for $35.00 per hour I need to go there in and out so my cost stays low. So, telling such the assistant and asking WHY she ask me these questions since it already is documented and known? The answer of hers was *I don't know it*. Over the years I had various treatment times there and many assistant and doctors and none of them ever ask such but referring always on HOW I FEEL now, and explaining what they intend to do this treatment time. The Doctors there listen and made adjustment accordly in pain relieve treatment. This time I was told NECK injections! My response to assistant was I can handle my neck even I am not comfortable and have pain there but I need help with my Sciatica (?) on my right side leg because I walk bend over to avoid terrible pains. She did not like my asking questions in my assertiveness and walked out. ", "A different assistant came and she was very friendly and so we concluded. Dr. Gupta, and another doctor came to the room.I was not told WHY there is another doctor present but after I ask was told; he is observing the treatment. .Out of respect to client I think it is only polite to ask and introduce such new people to be present, and give client a choice to be ok with such or, NOT. Like in my case I told the new tech assistant and also Dr. Gupta my driver cost me $35.00 per hour and I want to be treated without delay. Dr. Gupta refused to change the treatment and to focus on my severe back/leg situation and wanted a new requisition from my GP for such? By Now close to 3 hrs had past and so I could not effort more time to be there and told doctor \u00a0After leaving treatment room i spoke to manager on duty for staff there who in return told me she is forwarding my concern to SHARON who is the head manager of staff. and i would receive a call from her the next monday. This all while I spoke with kindness to the staff, Dr.Gupta and rest.of attending staff were mentioned who hindered treatment such I had come for and not teaching new staff. Monday after I went to my GP to request a new requisition for treatment. At the time GP told me GUPTA had called him and said I made his tech crying and upset and I was demanding. Maybe that's what he thinks but I intentionally never made anyone upset or was demanding, PERIOD! Doctors there deal with various folks in PAINS and ought to understand such. It is as is hard to compose oneself to get on in life! So, I left my GP without referral and told my GP that GUPTA called most likely because I told Gupta I would't take his behaviour and bring awareness of it to management. It is within my RIGHT to ask and raise questions and be treated for my pains. I am not there to prolong my stay nor have extra money for extra time of driver because they need to teach/observe!! Sharon the manager never called me. BUT I called her and it is midle stated SHARON had absolutely no empathy for my situation and come across uncaring and was COLDER than a fish on the phone. \u00a0My history of treatment over 14 years is well documented and I can't handle additional stress such as I experienced that day. Stress, It has side effect and throws me \u00a0out completely of limbo. It has and added extra conditions to my health such as the ROSACEA outbreak!! \u00a0I am seeking a different avenue for possibilities of help for my back/neck pains.. I thought never to write such review on ADVANCE SPINAL CENTER like many other's do but,time has come. \u00a0I write this review as it has happen to me, to the best of my knowledge ONLY. It is up to everyone to check facilities and staff aka doctors \u00a0and decide from there."]},

One of his \"front desk staff\" needs a bit of an attitude adjustment. She was slightly rude and very unfriendly. Anyway, A grand total of $263.00 ($363 including the deposit mentioned later) charged to my Credit Card. Acceptable I suppose. They then proceeded to give me a quote of $4,300.00!!! For an 11 year olds teeth? \u00a0No, Not braces... this estimate was for fillings, crowns and tooth removals. I think not. (We are going for a second opinion but there is a waiting list and that will be a few months away) They pushed the urgency and pressured me to make an appointment (for 8 days later) in which I needed to leave a $100.00 Deposit; The deposit to be kept if I did not cancel at least 2 business days in advance. Well at $4300.00 you can bet your bottom that I cancelled in search for a second opinion. I, in fact cancelled just 2 or 3 days later. My $100.00 Dollars was not refunded to my CC until I called them 2 more days later and demanded it. During this time, I went to put my claim into my dental benefits insurance company. (I specifically told the Dental office NOT to put the Claim through, as it is quicker for me to do it online). I discovered that not only did the Dental office put the claim through, they did this twice! Once for them to be paid (keep in mind I already paid them!) and once for myself to be paid. I called the office and got them to cancel their claim reminding them that I am to be sent the claim money, as they have been paid already, by ME! Well they did cancel one of the 2 claims, guess which one ... not the one where they get paid a second time! Well I called the insurance company, They suggested I try to get my refund from the dentist and if they do not comply the will be investigated for fraud. I was told by the insurance company that if the dental office calls they will give them the exact amount that has been sent by check so they can refund me immediately. \u00a0I called the dental office and spent most of my time on hold. They tried to tell me to wait until they receive the check. NOPE! \u00a0I demanded they call the insurance company and get that money amount being sent to them because I want my refund NOW. I have been through too much with this office and will not wait for them any longer. They once again put me on hold and when she returned I was told that the office manager was on hold with the insurance company and they will call me back as soon as they can. Nearly 2 hours later, I called them back and was informed they refunded the payment to my Credit Card. Thankfully 2 days later I saw the transaction of the refund on my CC.", "Now keep in mind that they did in fact refund all that was needed to be refunded, but, at what cost? It was a hassle and a fight, and emotionally/mentally exhausting dealing with this Company. They returned nothing until I demanded it.", "My personal opinion... I don't trust this company in least and I will NEVER return. Although Dr. Cameron himself was very good with my daughter, the company overall caused too much anguish. They should pay me for the trauma they caused over a 2 week period!", "Fraudulent company? \u00a0Scam company? \u00a0Money gouging company? \u00a0 You decide.", "Update.. Went for the second opinion and was quoted half of what Dr. Zealands office quoted!! Dr Zealand wanted to pull teeth that did not need to be pulled, double charged for fillings (on 3 teeth) wanted to put caps on baby teeth that are just about ready to fall out... and so much more... I advise you to STAY AWAY!!!!"]},

He rushed through the entire massage that was supposed to be a 60 min massage and ended up being about 45. I do not think this person knew anything about muscles, or he had any interest on the work he was performing. When I left I was asked how my massage was, I said \"terrible\". They rushed to get me out of there so other customers would not listen to my comments. One of the girls gave me an email address where I could send my comments to, I spent the time writing in detail about my experience but I never heard back from anybody in their office. If you want to go to the \"Walmart\" of massages, go to Massage Heights. You will save a few dollars at the expense of an absolutely terrible service."]},

Regardless I went ahead and the friendly receptionist explained me the procedures, asked if it was my first time and explained me the rules and the map. I still couldnt spend much time in the shower room either as the air was just too much. And neither was the spa. When I walked in my first impression was that the spa was just too small. It was on one level with only one sauna, hot bath and cold stations. I have been to several thermal spa places but this was kind of my first place where there wasnt any open air circulation going on. And since it was small I found my self having to wait for my turn. It was the same case in the relaxing room. The chairs or bags were too close to one another and I personally felt there was not enough privacy, with the whole time not having my nose open.

", "In 2012, I was doing a lot of walking and injured myself. I later found out that this was in fact plantar fasciatis (in my arch) and I lived with the pain for a long time (way too long). I visited a podiatrist, but was unsatisfied with very expensive orthotics given as the only treatment option. I did not carry on treatment with this doctor and instead just tried to manage the pain with regular foot rubs, using a tennis ball/water bottle to stretch it out, stretches for my calves and icing for pain as needed. ", "In 2014, and after over 2 years in chronic pain and not being able to withstand walking or intensive exercise (even still!), I decided it was time to try physiotherapy for the injury tried one other physiotherapist, but after 3 treatments (costing $80-90 each) I was unsatisfied with the treatment plan of icing my foot and a few stretches done by the physiotherapist and stopped that too. I thought there would be more than this having done some research on other physic treatment options for my condition. I will admit that not making time for it in my schedule had an influence on stopping treatment here but I didn't feel that the service, bedside manner and relief was worth the cost and time to get to this one. ", "Finally in March, I decided to make an appointment that someone had recommended and see if I could make use of my benefits over an intensive 4-6 week treatment period (going 2-3 times/week). The first appointment was quick and I found that Luis really listened to my concerns and seemed genuinely committed to trying whatever they could so I could finally get some relief. He recommended a regimen and said it would help to come 3 times a week if possible to see if I could nip it in the butt. My first treatment that day included hydrotherapy, ultrasound, heating pads, high frequency pulse(?), acupuncture, stretches and massage. I was very pleased and decided to book moreappointments for the next few weeks for 3 times a week. I spent 6 weeks in treatment with the same treatments every time and really started to notice a difference in my ability to walk long distances without pain and I needed less and less foot massages and at-home icing. After 6 weeks of intensive treatment I feel as though most of my pain is gone and I can manage it to make sure it doesn't come back through simple stretches, icing and massaging. Luis and his team really made in a difference for me and my injury - an incredibly positive outcome that I glad I finally took the time to deal with and receive the quantity and quality treatment I needed.", "I am really pleased with both Luis and his two assistants. Both very personable and easy to talk to. It was nice to chat while at the appointment. When they weren't there during the treatment, they would close the curtain and turn the light off so the patient could relax. They always made sure everything felt right - right intensity, temperature. It's a very small office, but is used very efficiently as far as keeping patients moving, but at the same time, they always ensured that the right care was given and they were never hasty. Booking appointments with the receptionist was a breeze and they were always able to accommodate me. ", "Not even the best thing about it for me (the relief post-treatment was the best) but, a very important factor in deciding to go to this office was the rates: $70 for initial treatment and $55 for each subsequent. ", "Great treatment for an affordable price plus super nice and caring staff! I haven't been to many but I can't imagine what else I would need in a physic clinic. I highly recommend this office."]},

The hi-tech computer displays all the damage of your skin currently--be it fine lines, scars, hyperpigmentation or sun damage and compares your results to the average woman in your age group (big sigh here). It even shows how you're going to progressively age and even how you're going to look.

I did not experience any break-outs after my first appointment BUT I was totally blown away at how bright and clear my skin looked after. I am a now believer.

We then negotiated changing part of my package and agreed that some treatment areas would be converted to other areas (e.g. treatment for arms is now for underarms).

I emailed back and, after approx. 4 business days, still had no reply.", "I then decided to write a negative review on Yelp so others could learn from my experience.

The delivery went well but my baby was forced to stay for a long time in the NICU. Most of my nurses where great but as my baby improved and needed less care, the quality of nurses took a nose dive. One nurse in particular (Elizabeth) wouldn't help me move my child in and out of his crib so I was struggling with a feeding tube, tape from strapping it to my chair and trying to properly wrap the baby up again with the hospital blankets. She would criticize me for not reading her mind as to what she expected me to do which was absolutely everything and she said I shouldn't have more children because this was my second early pregnancy and a third would be even earlier then the previous two. The list goes on with how nasty she was - I can't be bothered typing it all but you get the gist. Then the lady at the front desk reprimanded me for asking to have milk bottle labels printed when that's how it was always done through the duration of our stay (it turns out you have to ask your nurse who asks the lady at the front desk lol).

Scarborough is the absolute farthest point from where I lived in Toronto. A few days prior to this they said they were waiting for a bed at St. Mike's which is close to my home. Nobody updated me on how urgent it was to move my child in the next day or so and when the news was dumped on me, I had to ask several people for details - what campus, what time, etc. No mother going through the stress of having a preemie in the NICU should EVER have to deal with what I did. It was disgusting. Your fears run wild...'will my baby be handled with care if they don't even care enough to provide me with information?' etc.", "A couple of days after delivering my baby I also had to go to emergency to treat an epidural rupture that they caused and the people that check you in are TERRIBLE!!!

This pamphlet is actually from the hospital, and it tells you what you should do in each week (this week there's the anatomical ultrasound, this week you should book prenatal classes, etc). There was saying that we should book the hospital tour at the 35th week (I guess). I called them and they told me that I actually should have called one month earlier, because they were fully booked. I pointed out that they were the ones that told me to do that at that time but the lady was unmoved. I left a message to the Patient Affairs department just asking them to fix their material, because if people rely on the pamphlet they are in for a surprise - expecting nothing more than a fake \"alright, sir, will do\". They actually called me, very concerned about us not making the tour, and arranged us to be on the next one. I was very impressed.", "St. Michael's is a great place to have a baby.

They informed me to make a 500 deposit if I want to keep the package deal as it is not effective in july. So I made a deposit over the phone with my creditcard because I wanted to \"take advantage of this deal and not miss out\". I wanted a consult and if im happy then a treatment right after (due to distance/traveling). Came for consultation on time but had to wait; place was nice, hot towels and fruit infused water in what looks like a giant shot glass. Informative consult for fraxel and laser genesis/ipl. Initially wanted to do fraxel but they did not have real client pictures only fraxel company booklet pictures which probably comes with the machine. This is my first time lasering my face for redness and dark spots from past acne so I opted for less evasive procedure ipl even though they pressed for fraxel treatments saying it would address my problems. For ipl they recommended I purchase package of 6 sessions. But I chose just 3 to try it out. Had to wait around 30m for my treatment. Good thing I dont have work or had any other plans because this is definately not a lunch time drop by. Didnt mind the wait so I went to go eat somewhere and came back. Took pictures of my own face with my phone to document my own results. Facial felt like rubber bands hitting your face. I am wondering how many zaps/passes are done on the face because the laser is like 2inches by 1cm roughly. My session felt like the passes werent closely knit but far apart which made the session faster (less treatment/uneven). The time to prep was probably longer the treatment. I was finished in no time. I wanted time spent on my face to make sure every spot (whole face) is corrected with laser. Too bad my eyes have to be covered and i dont have a friend in the room to look at the work being done. Traffic there and back was horrible plus 20 for parking. Not much time was spent on my face which was my highest concern for my money. I asked for a refund on remaining of my package and they said director has strict no refund policy. I was never aware of this policy. To think if it was really strict they would at least have a sign on the front desk. Maybe I missed it? All I saw was chocolates and candies. Results? My face looked the same right after. I have to wait 2 weeks to see some changes."]},

Not only that, there was poor direction as where to start and register, and I had two people brought over to the triage nurse before me when I was waiting there long before them. Once the triage nurse saw me, he didn't even look at my vomit to see if their was blood in it, he did no use gloves, did not clean the equipment from the previous patient and was not really listening to how ill I was feeling not to mention the filth around the lobby area was off-putting to say the least.

He \u00a0didn't even bother to put on gloves and then started digging his nail into my vein to find a good one; he did not even wipe the area clean. Although he was great at inserting the IV, after he did not flush it, clean the area and put a proper splint under to hold it in place. He did not tell me any information, did not hand me the emergency bell and was very \u00a0unhappy to answer any questions I had and was extremely rude. I felt extremely worried and uncomfortable. The dirt on the ground and the table in the room made me not want to touch anything and I felt like even though how sick I was, Id rather be at home then feel better in here. About an hour later, the doctor came in and he was very friendly but, very nonchalant; he did how ever seem puzzled why no blood work was done and did not take into account my underlying health issues and sent me on my way. I did not feel comfortable being discharged but, they really made me feel like because i am young, i didn't matter.

I honestly thought I'd just have to accept the discomfort and pain, after all I'd tried EVERYTHING ....EXCEPT foot reflexology from Tim at Happy Foot. I'm not exaggerating, but this one reflexology session restored my foot. I feel NO PAIN, NO tightness, no discomfort. It's been two days of feeling thankful that I found Happy Foot (and Tim). I have no idea how crucial your feet are to everyday activities, until they are 'out of service'. I literally had tears in my eyes as I paid because I had forgotten how my feet felt prior to the fall. I had brand new feet. I can't thank you enough Tim/ Happy Foot, you've brought my feet back to life!!!! I'll be back soon! :D"]},

Bodyworks has no designated receptionist, but you wouldn't know it. In between appointments, the RMTs take turns checking emails and voice mails. I tend to email my appointment requests, because I don't always have time to make a phone call from work (and yet, I have time to write this review?). I send an email saying I want an appointment for Saturday mid-dayish, and I get a prompt response with a list of times available. If I book at least a week or two in advance, I usually get several choices (I suggest pre-booking at the time of your appt through). If they don't have any availability, they will always make the effort to find an alternative time or put you on the cancellation list. Sometimes the same email chain will have responses from several different people, so it just goes to show they share the responsibility of taking care of clients equally.", "So, appointment is booked, and I am counting down the days. I always have a glass of water or two before starting, and Alex sits with me and has an actual conversation about how I'm feeling and what I want to work on. In the past, I have worked with RMTs that don't necessarily discuss what you want. They may listen carefully, but I don't always know if I'm making myself clear because I don't know the names for all the muscles. With Alex, I am confident she knows what I mean when I gesture to my shoulder and, once again, complain about sitting at my desk for 8 hours a day.", "I like that the music isn't always whale sounds set to Bach - it's Frank Sinatra or \u00a0Norah Jones maybe. I love that there is always a heating pad to warm my cold toes in the winter and it helps to relax my muscles. I once went to an appointment when I was recovering from a nasty cold; Alex boiled some water, dropped a little peppermint oil in there, and put it under the head rest so I could inhale it while she worked on my back.

The waiting area is a series of chairs and enough room for a stroller as well. I didnt have to wait longer that 7 minutes so it was fine. The front staff was nice but behind a glass window...not sure why. The nurse who saw me first was not Dr. Kives' usual nurse but was covering because the other nurse was busy already with some patients.

I was like as long as there is no internal checking im fine. He was nice too and took the time to talk to us and explain quite a bit to us again as the nurse before. I mention taking the time because many health care professionals often dont and I think its important that they take time because we as the public dont know anything about medicine or the health care system so its refreshing when someone explains us stuff. ", "All in all the office staff was very friendly and the nurses were quite helpful. I will update once I get to meet my specific OB.

I read a bunch of reviews and decided that this sounded like the place for me. I called and left a voicemail, Vivita called me back that same day, super professional and friendly. We booked my appointment (within just a few days of my calling) and I was good to go. I arrived (it's a red door, the building is shared by two therapists as well as Vivita Spa), rang the labelled doorbell and Vivita came down, calm and smiling to welcome me in (note: I did ask later to make sure there was no one else there, and she said that she leaves half an hour between appointments so that there isn't any interruption for the client). We went up a set of stairs, past a nice seating area, into the spa room. The second I walked in, my stress level decreased and I felt relaxed already! You enter and are enveloped by the soothing smells of essential oils, a (cute) little humidifier going, calming music, soft lighting - da bomb! The room has soft lighting, a sink two massage tables (couples massage anyone?) a comfortable bench to sit on etc. There's a bathroom right next door to the room. Vivita offered me some water or tea and we sat down, I filled out the forms she gave me, we chatted and then she left the room so I could tear my clothes off (I don't waste time when it comes to this kind of stuff) and hop up onto the massage table. Vivita could not have made me feel more comfortable. She was kind and helpful, willing to talk when I wanted or just be quiet when I wanted to zone out. First I had the massage, and then (bonus!) you can stay on the massage table for the facial - hell yeah! So, after cleansing and doing lots of soothing things to my face (all sorts of pleasant, soothing things, I didn't ask, didn't care at this point because I was so relaxed), she warned me that she would be putting on the bright (tell all) light onto my face. She did the steam and extractions and then massaged in a bunch of soothing after lotions/moisturizers etc. Vivita makes her own skin potions and will happily explain to you what is in them.

Removal depends on many factors, including how long you've had the tattoo, quality of the ink, how healthy you are, etc. She was knowledgeable and very thorough. ", "- My first round of laser took less than 10 seconds. I won't lie - it's a very long, very painful 10 seconds with a powerful burning sensation - but it wasn't unbearable. She hooked me up with two massage balls to squeeze throughout.", "- The clinic gives you very detailed aftercare instructions, which ensures you have the best outcome possible from your treatments. It's been just over 24 hours for me, and I have just the tiniest bit of redness - no blisters or bruising. ", "THE BAD:", "- This isn't necessarily bad, but rather a forewarning: the Groupon covers only the cheaper of their two laser treatments (MedLite C6). Although 3 sessions are included with the Groupon, it typically takes at least 6 sessions to fully remove a tattoo. I paid for another 3 sessions upfront, bringing the total cost of my Groupon and additional sessions to just over $700 for 6 sessions total. It's still a good deal - without the Groupon, you're looking at over $1,000 for 6 sessions on a tattoo similar to mine (see their website for full pricing details).", "- The other laser, PicoSure, will remove your tattoo in fewer sessions (typically 2-4). I was quoted over $2,000 for this option. I think you can guess which way I went. ", "As 6 weeks are required between each session, I still have a long way to go before this tatty is gone for good.

I get facials about every 6 weeks because I believe it counts as maintenance as I age. Leila did my facial and was excellent. She examined my skin and then customized my facial. My skin looked refreshed afterwards. I knew I had found my new skin guru! Before leaving I asked her to recommend an eye cream and a toner as I was getting low on my products. She explained to only spritz a toner and not to run a cotton ball on my face as its better for Ph etc. I appreciated her tip and said that I was glad because I don't like to rub toners on my face anyway and always use spritzers. When I came to the lobby Leila had put aside recommendations. As for the toner she said that it doesn't come with a spray but that I could buy a pump from the dollar store and just switch out the top and insert the pump spray. No problem. Leila gets 5 stars. Love her.", "My bill was $388. I enjoyed the spa so much that I booked a facial for my husband the next day (Sunday). He gets facials quarterly and has been asking me to find a good place because his skin was looking tired. We are in our late 40's. Like I said, it's maintenance. ", "The next morning I opened my toner and realized there was no way you could take the top off and replace it with a spray pump. It's a plastic squeeze bottle with a tiny hole in the top so the only way you could spray it is if you squeezed the entire contents of the bottle into another bottle. For $43 there are spray toners out there instead of doing this. I want something I'm going to buy and use consistently. I'm not going to squeeze the contents out of one bottle to put into a spray bottle every single time I run out and have to buy a new one. That's just silly. I wrote the reason on the back of the receipt and asked my husband to return it when he went for his facial. It was less than 24 hours that I had the product, it was never used, I had the receipt and even put it back in the original packaging. No rips or dents, it looked exactly as it had when I bought it 18 hours earlier. ", "After my husband's facial he asked to return the toner explaining that I had written the reason for the return on the back of the receipt. The snotty blonde receptionist refused to take it back. My husband told her that it was poor customer service. He runs a company and understands the importance of taking care of the people that support you. My husband explained this to me via text. I decided to go inside when I picked him up because surely he got it wrong. He just spent around $100 and I spent almost $400 the day before. $500 in two days and they won't return $43? I went around and around with this gal explaining the situation. I explained I would not have bought it had I known I couldn't just change out the top. This is what I was told by a member of your staff. \u00a0I was infuriated that this was the customer service I was experiencing. The receipt did not say no refunds on it and nobody said anything about not being able to return it when I purchased it. I said to the girl, \"I get a facial almost every single month, my husband gets one every 3 months, we just spent $500 in here in the last two days and you are going to refuse to take back $43?!\" She held to her guns. I couldn't believe it. I was dumbfounded that someone could have such little business sense working in an industry that has so much competition. I told her, \"that's just stupid business. Do you realize how much money you are turning away?\" I loved my facial, my husband enjoyed his but yet, we will never step foot in here again because the employees who handle customer service are not trained to make informed decisions to provide good customer service. At this point an intelligent staff member came around the corner who had been listening. She quickly made an executive decision to refund my money. The blonde girl was annoyed but did as she was told. She never once apologized. She did say, \"Well I said you could have a credit on your account\". I looked at her and said, \"You never ONCE said that to me! Not one time did you offer anything at all. I would have taken a store credit because I would have come back for another facial but you did not offer it.\" All she said was \"I'm just doing what I've been instructed to do.\" Well honey, you just lost your owner about $2200/yr in revenue, (that doesn't even include massages that I try to get quarterly) not to mention how many people I would have recommended this spa to and you have now also earned yourself a bad review on Yelp. All for $43. I hope it was worth it. As I was walking out, I asked for the intelligent staff member's name. \"Doreen\". I then said, \"Please thank Doreen for me.\" Snotty blonde girl just gave me a smug look and said nothing. At some point, you need to suck up your pride and apologize to your customer. If not, people get mad and won't come back. Hence, I will take my business to one of the many other spas in Toronto."]},

As I half-floated and half sank into the moulded seat, and let my head be enveloped by the U-shaped cushion around my neck, Kat used a hose attachment that acted as an independent jet to go around my body and massage my lymph nodes, joints and limbs for a full 45 minutes. About ten minutes into the session, my stress melted into a puddle of nothingness and bliss took over. I could've been in outer space. The weightlessness combined with the hydro-massage felt like floating in Heaven.

It was my birthday this past weekend and I had gone to New York City to celebrate. On Sunday, we drove to Montauk. While I was on the beach there was a ridiculous wind that was funneling into my ears. By the night, I was a wreck. I knew it was just a cold, and when I woke up ten times worse the next morning, it was a confirmation. The final 5 hours of our drive back to Toronto were complete torture. For the last 30 minutes, I finally drove and it figures that in that time I got pulled over and got two tickets. Which is a rant for another time, so I'll digress. Let's keep in mind that as I'm getting sick it's the whole outbreak of the swine flu and every person I've ever met seems to be bringing up how all my symptoms are conveniently similar.", "After finally getting home and into my own bed, I just passed out. But waking up, I couldn't imagine feeling worse than I already had. And because I'm such a child when I'm sick and with all the thoughts of this swine flu that I really didn't know much about besides people deeming it a sars sort of epidemic, I called my mom in tears. Again, I'm without a doubt the biggest wuss when it comes to being physically ill. So in no time, she was there and I was trying to research clinics that would be open around 6:30. Finally I found this place that was open until 8, perfect. And I'd heard from a friend who had been to this clinic before and swore by it. By the time we got there and paid for parking we went to the clinic only to find that they were \"closing early due to the high number of patients.\" I lose my mind because at this point my only other option is the hospital and unfortunately my health card had expired the DAY BEFORE. So who knows how much that would cost me. But my mom is a regular spicy latina and called them immediately to complain about how she is a tourist in Toronto and doesn't know where else to go and technically they are still open. So eventually a nurse comes to finally open the door and lets us in.", "The wait is awful. Just to get to talk to the receptionist took well over half an hour. While talking to her, I told her that my health card expired the day before, but according to her, that wasn't a problem and I just needed to sign a release and go to the ServiceOntario office as soon as I could and bring them back my temporary health release. Awesome, so I don't have to pay anything. After about another hour I finally got into the doctor. At this point, it's 7:43 and I'm the very last patient. So he has more than enough time to listen to all of my symptoms. I get through about three of the things I'm feeling and he's checking my throat, ears and eyes. I've got a sinus infection. But what about my headache? Oh just take some tylenol. And my nausea? No response. Was he even listening? Probably not. But he did make sure to ask if I was a smoker, not once but twice. Which, both times I lied because let's remember my spicy latina mother is still in the room with us. I get a prescription and he leaves. I look at my watch. 7:47. After well over an hour and a half wait, I see the doctor for all of 4 minutes. And he didn't even listen to me in those four minutes. ", "Now I didn't have the swine flu, I'm perfectly healthy now. But it would have been nice to have a doctor who listened to everything I had to say before prematurely diagnosing me. I kind of wish I had the flu so I could come back and cough all over him. I'm that kind of girl.", "My frustration with the place didn't end there, though. The next morning, I take the day off work because I still feel like shit and getting out of bed is a feat, but that doesn't stop The Doctor's Office from calling me and telling me that my health card is expired. Dear bitchy receptionist, I'm very aware of that fact and I told your other shit receptionist the same thing yesterday. \"Well you have to go fix this problem now, OHIP will not be paying us for you visit so either you go deal with your expired card or you have to come here and pay us $75.\" Check my file, I'm seriously sick and the last thing I have energy for is going to ServiceOntario and fixing a mess that is entirely your receptionist's fault. \"Well, we'll be calling you tomorrow and every day until this is rectified\" REALLY? You're going to harass me until I'm well enough to give you 75 measly dollars?", "This place is full of people who could care less about taking care of those who are sick. It's an office full of people who got a job in the health industry because it's the only industry with reliable jobs right now. It's a cash grab and if you want a doctor that actually gives a shit, don't go here. But I'm told there aren't any doctors left that actually give a shit. If I'm wrong, let me know. I'm desperate for some health help."]},

But how was I to know who she was? Should I get out and wait? But I would be waiting naked in a women's shower! That's just far too creepy a thing to do. Eventually, a woman came in in her bra and underwear with a caddy full of massage things. She scanned the shower quickly and saw me \"Number 22?\" She asked? I was relieved. She showed me to the massage area where there was another woman lying tits up on a table being rubbed all over. Um... was this going to be me? But it seemed to late to back out now--even rude, maybe to say I wasn't comfortable with this.

Midwives aren't for everyone: you have to have a low-risk pregnancy to stay in their care. As soon as any small problem is detected they will tranfer you to a doctor. My pregnancy, aside from small fundal height, has gone relatively smoothly, so I rarely needed to contact them outside of our appointments (looking back, I think I've contacted them twice). This may be a key reason why my experience was quite different from the other posters. ", "When I first met with Seventh Gen I wanted continuity of care that comes with a midwife, but I was worried they would be against many things, like pain killers, c-sections, vaccinations, \u00a0induction, etc. In a nutshell, I was worried they would be overly into newage stuff. I was surprised to learn they are open to everything. They actually had to convince ME to keep myself open to options, like painkillers or induction, \u00a0just in case it becomes a necessity. ", "My midwives, Alana and Kim, are both lovely. They are calm and knowledgeable. I wasn't too excited about having a student midwife join us (I've had bad experiences with residents i.e. student doctors), but I understood that it was an option (i.e. I could request to no longer see her). Well, I lucked out; I love the student midwife Vanessa. She has such a warm bedside manner! I believe she's nearly finished her training and I think she'll make a great midwife. ", "If I have a question they are easily accessible. The pager doesn't bother me; they offer birth centre births, home births, and hospital births, so this is a good way to stay in touch with them. When my cousin (a doctor) is on call, I believe he uses a pager as well, so I think it's farly common in the healthcare industry. \u00a0I wouldn't want them answering their cell phone or office phone while they are with me, so I can't expect them to do that with other patients. Leaving a message with the reception desk is always an option, like any clinic.", "The receptionists are a little spacey. In my experience, if things get slightly disorganized it has to do with the front desk (e.g. booking the wrong time, booking too far down the line, forgetting to notify the midwife that the patient is in the waiting room). Although I was told to check the message on the pager before coming in, I have always been notified by phone on the rare occasion that clinic is rescheduled due to a birth. In terms of notifying current clients of clinic rescheduling, the front desk is running very well. I haven't had trouble reaching the front desk on the phone.. erm, excluding lunch hours, when they seem to sneak off :)", "This is a long review, I suppose because it's a more important decision to make compared with deciding where to eat :) The best thing you can do is follow your instinct. If a midwife sounds right, meet with them and see if you like them. If a doctor sounds better, do that. Maybe you're unlike me and like newage stuff. Maybe doulas offer that. Everyone and every pregnancy is different. :)", "I haven't given birth yet. I'm due in May, so I'll do my best to provide a follow-up review then."]},

Needless to say, I deprived myself from several food groups hoping to eliminate my symptoms but they still persisted. I never saw Maha during this year because I couldn't afford it.", "Months later, at 95lbs, I needed help. My family was concerned for my health because I continued to lose weight. I ended up seeing a new GP in Toronto, who told me that food allergy testing is \"invalid\". When I heard this, I was in shock. There I was with my 3pg report showing him all the foods that I am allergic too and he told me that this form of food allergy testing is basically \"not scientifically supported\". I had no idea about this, taking Maha's words that the test was valid.

To make a long story shorter, my abdominal discomfort and constant diarrhea was the result of chronic anxiety, not food allergies. Now taking Zoloft, my symptoms have subsided. I am gaining weight back and am able to participate in normal everyday activities that I used to miss out on because I was constantly ill.

Holy eye-gasm! I got my new eyes about 7 years ago, and I haven't looked back. Get it? LOOKED BACK? Nothing? Alright then.", "I have to echo Erin B's great review a little bit, but she's absolutely right. The offices are as relaxing as you can get. I suppose there's so much stigma surrounding this procedure, that they want the vict--err, patient to be as comfortable as possible. Leather couches, wi-fi, plasma TVs, music, snacks, and extremely kind yet professional people working there, really make you feel like you're hanging out, and not preparing to risk blindness.", "I dare not get into pricing, because", "1) It varies depending on the complexity of your eye problem, and", "2) Back then, I paid a Scrooge McDuck fortune, compared to what it probably costs now.", "I'm sure the biggest question for most people isn't the niceness of the office, but of the specifics of the procedure itself. Let me take you to school with a half-assed Readers Digest version:", "When you have sight issues, it's generally due to a lack of light getting in through the corneas. The procedure determines if you have enough corneal tissue to spare, the laser will fry some of it, and once removed, it allows the proper amount of light to get in, perfecting your vision.", "When you go in for your consultation, they put you through a series of tests: The general eye test (\"What letter is that? Is this better or worse?\"), a scan of your eyeball, and the test of your corneal tissue. I have to be honest, the corneal tissue test bothered me more than the procedure itself. You're given eye-drops which freeze your eyes, and you watch in horror, as the doctor pokes and prods your eyeballs with what looks like a tampon from hell. You don't feel anything, but you can see your vision jitter back and forth as he's doing it. Yerrgh. Afterward, all of your eye's info pops up on a monitor, and they give you a rundown on if you're putting yourself at any risk by doing the procedure. Fortuntely, my eye-flesh is awesome, so I got the green light.", "When you return for the procedure, you're offered a sedative, which I declined. You're then led into a room very unlike the rest of the office. It's medieval. I don't mean in an unsanitary rusty cage sort of way, but in a sterile, operating room sense. You get up on a metallic table and they give you a numbing eye-drop. This one was unlike the one in the consultation, this one kind of frosts your vision a little bit. You rest your head inside this plastic thing to kind of hold it in place, and you're given the speech about the machine. Basically, if you move an inch, the laser will shut itself off automatically, and they have to waste time restarting it, so it's best if you hold still. They do a great job of easing you into the actual 'beaming', and when it comes, I can only hypothetically describe it as a psychedelic trip whilst sober, sans Pink Floyd and regrets. You're treated to all sorts of swirling colours, and it's all pretty cool, though I can see why it may panic some people, especially with the faint smell of burning flesh making its way into your nostrils.", "After zapping you for a few minutes, you see what I can best describe as a windshield-wipe of your eyes, and you can suddenly see perfectly. I hesitate to mention that the 'wipe' is actually a SCALPEL SLICING YOUR SCORCHED EYEBALLS. Booga booga!", "And that's it. As mentioned in Erin's review, the office is quite bright, but I was warned before going back in to put on sunglasses. They offer you VR-trooper-looking shades, but I brought my own. Once in the bright area, I had to sneak a peek without the glasses. When I lifted them slightly, it was awesome. As they noted, it almost doesn't seem real immediately after the procedure, and everything I was looking at had an early-days-of-CGI (real, and yet sort of animated) look to it. That sensation was soon gone, and that signaled the month o' eye-drops that I was just beginning.", "As for side-effects, they do warn that for the first little while, you might see white glows above people at night (they call them \"haloes\"). I never experienced them, but streetlights gave off a really trippy effect. They looked like they were spewing random beams of light everywhere. Headlights were disorienting as well, which made night-driving impossible for a while. Small price to pay for being able to read street-signs, alarm clocks, and subtitles with the greatest of ease, if you ask me.", "So, 7 years later, how do I feel? I feel like my vision isn't quite as perfect, though they do tell you that reading glasses are inevitable down the road. I would say I'm still pretty close to 20/20 though, and this procedure is one of the best investments I've ever made. Just ignore the horror stories, and go for a consult, four-eyes."]},

We were urged to take off our shoes and place them in separate lockers (I usually share lockers for ease of only having to carry one key but she requested we separate out the shoes so we did - I was with my one friend). \u00a0Once you put away your shoes, the hostess exchanges your shoe key for a locker key inside the change room. Payment is $20 cash or $20 + tax if not paying cash. You get a very roomy t-shirt and long shorts - orange for women and blue for men - and 2 small gray towels. The women's change room is to the left and the men's is to the right. ", "Inside the (women's) change room there is a showering area where no clothes are permitted (not even swim suits!). The lockers are HUGE so you can potentially bring your entire closet if you need to get ready there before a night on the town. If you do plan on showering there (it's required before you entire the sauna) then I would recommend bringing a larger towel from home to dry yourself off. We also brought our own clean pair of flip flops to wear inside but I saw many people walking around bare footed. ", "Once you're all showered and changed you enter the main lobby where there are couches, TVs playing Korean shows, and a small dining area in the middle. If you're hungry there's a variety of food you can get ranging from simple instant noodle cups (there's a pretty decent variety of these), kimbap or chips if you're not too hungry or even full rice and meat plates, not to mention the eggs. I didn't get any but the guy sitting at the table across from me had a plate of what looked like bulgogi, white rice and kim chi (it looked really good, we were eying him pretty hard lol!!!!). \u00a0There's also drinks such as aloe or even beer (Sapporo and Canadian) if you want! If you don't want to pay for drinks and you're thirsty, there's a water dispenser on the left of the bar for free in addition to them allowing you to bring in empty water bottles for your personal use. When you get food you only need to show them your locker number and they add the charge to it so you can pay when you leave - you don't need to carry money around.", "Now onto the sauna rooms! When you enter there is a large room that's about 25 C that has mats for you to use in the hotter rooms. There are about 9 (I don't remember exactly) including 1 ice room with a big wall of ice. The sauna rooms are made with various crystals and stones that are supposed to have different healing properties. All this information is listed right outside each room for you to peruse. The rooms themselves are quite small, some fit perhaps \u00a04-5 people comfortably. The temperatures range from 32 C all the way to a whopping 92 C (this room has wooden seats). We tried the 32 C, 42 C, and 78 C. My personal favourite was the 42 C as it was hot but not too hot that it was uncomfortable. So I still got sweaty but I wasn't struggling to breathe as I did in the 78 C room. \u00a0Since we were all new to the sauna we didn't try the 92 C room but I think I will next time. ", "Overall it was a great experience and I will be back again. We were there for about 4 hours but it didn't feel like 4 hours at all! Time just flew. The best thing about this place, besides the saunas (obviously), is that there are tabletop games that you can play (I remember seeing Jenga and Scrabble in their little collection) while you eat or just hang out in the lobby area. If their selection isn't to your liking you can even bring in your own games - I brought in Settlers of Catan to play. ", "Lastly, there is in and out privileges. I had left Catan in my car as I wasn't sure if the locker was large enough to fit both my bag and the game so I had to go back out to get it. There was various slippers that you can use to walk outside placed around the front area so you don't have the take your shoes out of the locker. I thought this was a really thoughtful touch!"]},

The dressing room is pretty clean, and two small hot and cool tubs are available in the women's shower room, that s awsome, but I felt a little bit embarrassing and shy when naked in front of other nakes, LoL. The spa is quite considerate, it supplies towels, shampoo, soap, body lotion, skin firming lotion, Q-tips, combs, hair dryers, toothpasta and weigning scales, for free, but it s better to bring ur own personal cares, like face cares, washcloth, toothbrush and towel. The hall is huge, there was already quite a few poeple there, some are Korean families, kids r a little bit noisy. Foot massage and body massage service are provided, I will try next time. A snack bar is open almost 17 hours in the hall, it opened at 9:15am in the Sunday morning, I did not know when it closed, but for sure, after 3am. It sells all kinds of snacks, like Korean style instant cup noodles(CAD4.5), sweat rice drink(CAD3.5), baked eggs(CAD0.80), maki rolls(CAD4.5), seasonal soup(CAD8.00), bulgogi(CAD13.00), ice tea/coffee(CAD2.50), snacks(CAD2.00), ice creams and all kinds of canned/bottled drinks(include some beers), but a little bit pricing. The cold water machine and cups is located at the left of the store, for free. The hot water is charged for one dollar per cup at the snack bar. In front of snack bar, 13 dinning tables and chairs are available for guests. Two billiard tables are setted in the middle of the hall, bunch of cues are hanging on the pillars besides the tables, but should pay CAD2.00/round. 14 coaches are against two sides of the walls, guests were hanging out or sleeping on them, two TV are around them, one was for English movies, another was showing Korean funny programs. At the end of the hall, there r two entrances to sauna area. The sauna halls is warmer than dining hall, like a yoga room with some bamboo mats and yoga mats. Six hot sauna rooms and one ice room are really attractive. The temperature were variable. The lowest three rooms were like 39-44 centigrade, one was about 72 and the hottest one was 99. I felt I was like a baked bacon when I slept in it. I applied aloe vera gelly on the face, arms and legs in the sauna room, I could feel the pores were open, absorbing aloe vera gelly.

Korean scrub and massage are not a relaxing experience, the scrub will take layers of you skin off(it will teach you how to wash properly) and the massage will bend every muscle in your lifeless body.

The doctor was noticeably young, not a bad thing but I've had some issues with younger doctors before due to inexperience. It wasn't long until he alleviated any doubts I had though. He was quick, professional and had done his homework on the file by reviewing an important piece of information from a previous exam that would aide in his diagnosis. We were here because of an ongoing/previously diagnosed issue that had come up again. In short we had been to 4 different doctors already and the diagnosis was split, this was now the 5th doctor visit! We had done our share of research, so we had a good idea of what it was, what it wasn't but still there was a piece of the puzzle missing which led us here on this evening. After a quick review of the file we final had our missing piece, he was confident in his diagnosis and what he said made more sense than any previous explanation. Previous explanations came with hesitation and this one did not, we were happy to finally be affirmed with an adequate answer and resolution to the medical concern.", "So to close, the environment was clean, comforting and well maintained. Everyone was very friendly and knew how to add light humor to an unpleasant situation, a nice touch with some delicacy. Beyond the light conversation everyone was at all times professional, efficient and well aware of the potential emergency at hand.

I had to take a day off work to get the monitor put on, and was told over the phone it would be no big deal to return it after work the following day, but sure enough I show up and am given paperwork to fill out that states it has to be back by 8am the following morning, which simply wasn't possible. I told the nurse this, and that I couldn't afford to take another day off just to return the monitor, and she seemed rather concerned, but went and talked to a colleague and determined it should be okay, and promised to note on my file that it would be back in the afternoon. Sure enough, at 9am I get a call from the Rockyview asking where their monitor was.... and then another one at 11 \"reminding me how critical it is that I return this equipment immediately\". Good job, folks.", "All in all, it could have been a lot worse, and I've seen similar situations be far worse elsewhere. Wait times here are NOTHING compared to the Foothills or PLC, and (most of) the staff are knowledgable, helpful, and friendly.

I'm not huge on steam rooms as I tend to overheat, but this one was the perfect temperature, and there seemed to always be a waft of fresh air coming from somewhere. There was also a shower inside the room, so you could cool down or rinse off.

It's about double what I pay for a massage at the clinic, but it's such a lovely and relaxing experience, I definitely plan to go back.", "I should note that I have a nut allergy, and every therapist and technician double checked the products to make sure they were safe for me before using. I felt absolutely safe.", "My package included lunch, which for me was perfectly cooked salmon and asparagus from the restaurant downstairs.

Isn't your health important to you?\" I went for 1 or 2 adjustments before receiving several emails consistently cancelling appointments for weeks at a time.

So now I am left waiting for several days wondering if there is something wrong with my back or neck.", "At the seminar Dr. Kilian does an excellent job of making you afraid. He makes you afraid of your back, of what will happen if you don't see him, afraid of your poor diet and lack of exercise. Again, he has only seen you for about 20 minutes at that point and has no idea what your diet or exercise habits are like. At the same time he is ranting about the breakdown of the art of healing in society today. He tells you not to get a flu shot (because he is that kind of a Dr.?), to question the meds you take, and not to trust your regular doctor. This whole time I was wondering under what authority he is handing out this guidance. He is a chiropractor, not a medical doctor.", "Also, during this long presentation, Kilian also states that women are birthing children the wrong way. A point which I attempted to contest him on and had my issues pushed aside because of \"time\". I just couldn't understand where he was coming from, and what right he had to say things like this. How much damage has he done because a susceptible person didn't get a flu shot because of him? Or maybe someone went off their meds? It's impossible to know, but I have never seen a chiropractor that has acted in this way or spoke to such serious issues when they did not have the proper training to speak about them.", "Kilian also stated that he has an amazing neck and back \"despite working with fatties all day.\" This was just mind blowing to me. What sort of professional talks about their clients that way? I was simply shocked. ", "Kilian then goes on to present you with four stages of spinal decomposition. He uses stories and x-rays of past clients. I wondered if he has their permission to use these images. At this point you are blown away by the x-rays of people with skeletal hump backs. And guess what, he saved ALL of them. Every single one of Kilian's client stories ends up in him healing their back, their sinus issues, their IBS all from the correction of their backs", "After he goes through this long presentation he takes each client into the back, one at a time, to review their x-rays. If you are at the end like me, you are just dying to know what your spine looks like. When I went back there he reviews my x-rays and tells me I am stage 2. I was so worked up at this point I almost started crying. A stage 2! But guess what, he can help you, with a payment plan of course. He asks me, \"Do you want to fix this? Because I can help you.\" Of course you say yes, because you were just listening to him for the last hour as he told you that you will become a hunched over old person that can't even look at the sky if he doesn't correct you. He asks me to make the commitment to come in three days a week for 3 months at a rate for $500 a month. Again, I was so worked up over his presentation and the x-rays he showed me of his past humped backed patients, that this seems like the only thing that can save me.", "He then corrected me, but just my neck, even though I have issues with my lower back and left hip. This correction left me with a tension headache for over a week, which becomes relevant later. He sends you to the front to talk to his wife who takes your money and schedules you for your appointments. I booked my next appointments for 7am Monday, Wednesday and Thursday morning and went to meet a friend. I can vividly remember going to dinner and almost being in tears because I was so concerned over my back. ", "Monday morning comes around and as I am getting ready to go I receive an e-mail at 640am stating that all appointments will be cancelled for the day and to please call to reschedule. I call in and reschedule for Tuesday. Tuesday comes around and I get another e-mail stating that all appointments have been canceled for the day, please call and reschedule. I do this again and the receptionist says to schedule something on Wednesday when I come in for my regular appointment. On Tuesday afternoon, while at work, I receive another e-mail stating that all appointments for the rest of the week have been cancelled. At this point I am highly suspicious because I just gave Kilian $500 for appointments I have yet to receive. I am also bothered by the fact that not at no point was I phoned by his office to apologize for the stream of cancellations. ", "I call the office later that day and ask for a a refund of the $495 that I paid them a week before. I was then informed that because he corrected me the night of the seminar that I would not be getting the money back for that correction."]},

It was my first time visiting a naturopath and I was under the impression that they are \" real doctors\" but perhaps have been given an unfair bad rap by the conventional medical practices. I also thought that the naturopaths objective is to assist the bodies natural healing processes through various supportive measures.", "The experience did not match any of my pre conceived ideas about an earthy, compassionate interest in my well being. The doctor spoke so fast that it was impossible to catch entire sentences of what she was saying. It seemed that she had a canned presentation that involved making a pitch on a myriad of expensive lab tests, and then she talked about various injections and a treatment plan for imbalances in hormones, glucose, adrenal glands, thyroid, etc. This was entirely her agenda and had absolutely nothing to do with patient autonomy. My impression is that she reviewed the five or six page intake form that is required in advance, and then created her plan of action before I even arrived. We were on different pages the entire visit.", "I was an RN for over thirty years so I questioned the rationale for some of those lab tests. She said, \"well, if you can't afford these...we could do such and such.\" At the very end of the one hour consult, and right out of the blue, she produced a 3 cc syringe and approached me saying that she was going to inject something ( I was not sure if she said Dexamethasone, or dextrose and alcohol) into the nerve beside my left eye, and also inject the same substance into my Achilles' tendon. \u00a0I was quite taken aback and said, \"no way!\".", "In addition, she had a very strong opinion that one should eat very little fruit, and seemed to think that because I eat a lot of fruit that I must have blood sugars that are out of whack, which is simply not true. Insulin resistance is determined by factors such as waist to hip ratio, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, diet high in processed food, \u00a0and genetic factors. She also told me that the vertical ridges on my fingernails are a sign of protein deficiency. But, that is simply not true. Vertical ridges on finger nails is a sign of aging and quite normal. ", "The clincher for me, and reason for this low rating is that the ND did not examine me, or even take my pulse or blood pressure. If she had concerns about blood glucose, She could have done a simple random blood glucometer reading in her office. In my opinion, and experience, there is a great deal that can be gleaned about a patients overall health if you take the pulse for a full minute and a manual blood pressure reading. The other basic and rule of thumb for most practitioners, is that you never inject a person with any substance without having them wait for 15-30 minutes following the injection, in case there is an adverse reaction. To me, these are things that are as basic as it gets. I had always believed that naturopaths get a bad rap. Now I know why."]},

I've yet to get my first tattoo, but so far I've had my nose, lip, and navel pierced. I am by no means an expert on the subject... but I've done it before.", "When I first got my nose pierced, it was at a reputable shop (Strange City in Edmonton), with a great piercer. The lady who pierced my nose did an excellent job and I couldn't have been happier... Until I went to change my stud to a ring, and it was IMPOSSIBLE to find a ring that fit! She had pierced my nose so low, that every ring hung off a ridiculous amount. I would buy thin rings, and then cut them with nail clippers and try to bend them back into shape. I did this for about 2 years before I gave up (the rings would always bend out of shape when I tried to make them smaller myself) and I just took my nose ring out completely and let it heal.", "But I wasn't myself without my nose ring! It was like a part of my identity! So I set out looking for a place in Vancouver to get it done. I've heard a lot of good things about Sacred Heart... but it is so expensive! I had passed by Gastown Tattoos often, and decided to take a gamble and check them out. I did my research online, and didn't find any crazy cases of diseases or lawsuits coming from them... and they seemed to know their stuff based on the website. Also, they only charge $50 for a nostril piercing (most places charge about $80!). So I decided to give it a try. ", "I went in and met with Chris. I explained my nosering woes and he took a look and agreed that my piercing was very low before... and that he could pierce it higher. ", "The shop definitely has its own unique traditional style... which makes it look really cool... but borderline grungy. Most tattoo/piercing shops I've been to are extremely sterile-looking and they almost look like hospitals (which is comforting when you're going to have a needle shoved through you)... But I decided to go ahead with it and accept their style... trusting that just because it looks cluttered (which is undeniably cool), does not mean it is unsanitary.", "I was a bit of a difficult customer, because I thought I wanted to get pierced with a hoop... but this is what happened:", "Chris had already picked out a stud for me with a clear stone. I mentioned that I wanted to get it pierced with a hoop but I was scared the hoop would be too big again. So, he showed me the hoops and we tested them out to see if they would be too big. The smaller ring would be JUST too small to pierce with (in case there was swelling), and I didn't want the bigger ring because it just looked too big to me. So I wanted to go with a stud... but I didn't really want to go with the clear stone because I already have so many like that at home from my previous nostril piercing. He showed me the other option, but the ball was kind of big so I decided it would probably be best to just go with the one he picked out in the first place (sorry for being so difficult Chris!).", "Then came the piercing time. He was really great at walking me through step by step what he was going to do. It hurt more than I remember the first time, but not too much (maybe it was because I was such a difficult customer... ha ha but hey! I just know what I want!). You can't really complain about the pain though!", "Then, I went to take a look and I was shocked to see my nose was really bloody! That never happened before! None of my piercings EVER bled. I was a bit alarmed and even mentioned it to Chris. He explained that because he cleaned the inside of my nose and not just the outside... it is more susceptible to bleeding. I googled it online and found that it wasn't as uncommon as I thought to bleed when you get pierced... so I felt a bit better about that.", "Then, Chris did something really awesome for me! Because I already had a clear stone stud at home, and really wanted the hoop, he gave me the hoop for free! He said I can just come on back to have it changed out when its healed. I was super happy with that!", "Over all, it was one of the better piercing experiences I've had (and least expensive). I \u00a0might pop back down soon for my first tattoo!"]},

Dr.Kumar has given me my confidence back, and I'll always be so thankful. After my mini lip injection, I decided I wanted the full lip injection procedure & I'm so happy I did.

I used to have a very full upper lip, but after I had braces removed, my upper lip basically deflated - and I always disliked them afterwards. It was so frustrating. I found tons of forums online about girls who had the same issue. Dr.Kumar has made my lips look perfect again, I actually look forward to putting on my lipstick and gloss now :) the procedure is quick and painless, and the results are fantastic. Dr.Kumar is an artist with fillers, and I will not trust anybody else with my face. I also got a touch up on my chin cleft, & Dr.Kumar did this free of charge. My chin looks so much more softer now & slightly pointed, giving my lower face definition that I always dreamed of having. My cleft is more of a shadow now, as opposed to being concave crevasse. I also got botox in my chin at my last appointment as stated in my last review (I obviously didn't need anymore yet) and this has complimented the filler in my chin beautifully. When I talk & eat, my chin doesn't pebble up.", "Nothing is more wonderful then a doctor who is kind and generous. Every time I see Dr.Kumar, I feel like I'm talking to a friend, and comfort with your doctor is of the most utmost importance. My next procedure will be under eye filler for my dark circles, I'm beyond excited to do this & will update my review then as well. I believe in giving credit where credit is due, & I will always update my reviews with each procedure that gives me confidence. Definitely go to C\u00fcR Laser for fillers & Botox- you will leave feeling beautiful & confident :)"]},

Dr. Kumar is a medical doctor. He administers all the injections - not a nurse or an assistant. This means that he has proper medical training and knows what to do in case of an emergency. This is a big plus for me.", "2. Excellent free consultations: Dr Kumar is extremely patient, friendly and thorough. During my consult, I never felt rushed even though I tend to be a bit long-winded and paranoid about side effects. Dr Kumar answered all my questions and concerns. He really listened to what I was after and broke down the cost of how much everything would cost. I found this really refreshing since most clinics won't talk about pricing unless you ask, and then you feel awkward and cheap for asking. At the end of the consult Dr Kumar even asked, \"Do you have any more questions?\" What a nice guy!", "3. Extremely generous: I had fillers injected into my tear troughs and cheeks. I was really satisfied with the results. When I came in for my follow-up appointment, Dr Kumar suggested that I add more filler to my tear trough since there was still some hollowness under my eyes. ", "I figured, why not. I'm getting old, I might as well invest in my face! So, I said, okay. Well, imagine my surprise when he told me that there would be no charge for the tear troughs! What?!! He injected two syringes at my follow-up appointment. That's a couple hundred dollars right there. All comped! Well that's not all. Dr Kumar asked me to come in again for a follow-up to my follow-up appointment. At that third appointment, Dr Kumar injected a little bit more into my tear troughs. No charge again.", "Who does that? I mean, seriously. Who does that?! That's incredibly generous. I can't imagine that happening at any clinic I've ever gone to. In fact, I can imagine the opposite happening - being pressured to have more added so that I can be charged more. That's some serious generosity going on!", "4. Dr Kumar genuinely seems to care: After my first injections, Dr Kumar texted me side-by-side before and after photos. He told me that now I have his cell phone number, so I can text him any questions about after care. ", "Again, who does that? I have never met a doctor who would freely give out their phone number to patients. This is really impressive patient care!", "Additionally, after my first filler treatment, I had some minor bruising on my cheek. Dr Kumar gave me a complimentary laser treatment to help with the bruising. He didn't need to do this. He could have told me that bruising is a normal side effect and to ice it, but he was genuinely concerned and wanted to make it better.", "5. Reasonable prices: after your first treatment, you're signed up for Cur's rewards program. This makes future treatments much cheaper. After doing a lot of research and emailing back and forth with various clinics in Vancouver, I've found that Cur's prices are very reasonable. Add in the loyalty discount, and the treatments are a pretty good deal!", "In summary, this is a great clinic! It's cozy and clean. The staff are friendly, and Dr Kumar is easily the best doctor/injector I've met! I'll definitely be back when I'm in town."]},

He spent about 30-35 minutes giving me the most in depth consultation I have ever had! He took photos of my face before treatment, and then we looked at the photos together and he listened to me talk about what I wanted, and then explained what he could do, and the cost it would take to get there. I have never felt like I had a doctor genuinely care like this before, not to mention today is a holiday so he came in on his day off! \u00a0He is realistic, and doesn't make crazy promises. My skin goals need to be obtained over a few visits (due to my budget) and I was so pleased he was upfront with costs and options, and also gave me a brief explanation of how the product works. I am so excited to book more appointments, and I am more than thrilled that I have found the perfect doctor to help me reach my goals. I live downtown and I am not even phased in the slightest about commuting to Main street, because his work is well worth it!"]},

I made the regrettable mistake of booking an appointment with Dr. Glenn Cashman. I would like to preface this review by stating that I have been seeing a chiropractor back home for 15-plus years, and let me be the first to say, this is not the way it is done! The several glowing reviews posted on Yelp are false and misleading. First of all, the office is an absolute dump! Old, filthy-looking, run-down place, badly in need of refurbishment. More importantly, however, was Dr. Cashman's rather unfortunate approach to pretreatment. The sergeant drill-like questionnaire posed to me by the doctor was incredibly off-putting and offensive. Apparently, this was a requirement in order to receive actual treatment. So, the generic office form he makes you fill out in the waiting room does not suffice to illuminate the problem? Now, Dr. Cashman has to waste another 20 minutes of your time going through an endless amount of completely irrelevant and redundant questions so that he can justify his initial \"half hour consultation\" fee? A thousand pointless questions posed in brusque military fashion. Interesting. I was lead to believe that I had booked an appointment for chiropractic treatment. Not an interrogation session with an Israeli drill sergeant. Did this individual just graduate from chiropractor school? Either way, I cut him off half way through the \"cross examination\", as I simply did not have the patience to endure more of this pompous, self-important character and his inane questions. Maybe he was under the impression that he has about to perform open-heart surgery. Meanwhile, I just needed an adjustment. I would strongly suggest avoiding this clinic."]},

He knows exactly what will look good and makes it look natural (if you want gigantic, fake looking fish lips, you may want to look elsewhere). His approach is on the conservative side and he says we can always add more later. Second, the care and attention to detail is impeccable (e.g. for botox, he used a new syringe for every poke - this not only allows the needle to be sharp and not hurt as much in each subsequent poke, but allows him greater control with the number of units he puts in each spot). Third, the service - for filler, he texted me before/after pictures while I was there and then followed up with text a few days later to see how I was doing. I wasn't rushed in and out like in some places, rather he stayed in the room and talked to me about the treatment while waiting for the numbing cream to kick in.

You lay down right under the laser and try your best to get comfortable. You'll get numbing eye drops which sort of sting when they're first administered. (Hey, where was the Valium I was hoping to get?) My heart was beating pretty heavily at this point but they explain every step of the way what's expected of you and what they're doing to you. Left eye gets covered first and your right eye gets clamped open. You concentrate on a red blinking light. The assistant announces \"30 seconds,\" at which point Dr Kirzner starts to apply the solution to wipe away the epithelial layer of your eye. Laser starts up and he warns you that you'll smell something like burning hair. I don't feel a thing. I just hear the laser beams doing their thing and my eyes can literally see the patterns that are being burned away. So cool!!! And then it's done within seconds and he covers my eyeball really quickly, then blasts a cold cold liquid solution into my eye. He says, \"brain freeze!\" to warn me beforehand. A number of different eye drops are administered, then the bandage lens is put in which is basically a contact lens. The eye patch is removed and placed on the opposite eye and all is repeated. Done!", "I was escorted to the recovery room and laid on a chaise to relax. I was given eye drops to put in 10 minutes later on my own. There was a patient's husband waiting for her in there as well and at one point I started to sit up and chat with him. I was promptly told to lay back and close my eyes by one of the assistants. Oops! It just goes to show how uncomplicated the procedure can be. I felt like I could see pretty well at this point. About 45 minutes later Dr Kirzner came out of the surgical suite to quickly take a close look at my eyes, put in more eye drops, and then let me go. ", "I have my follow up the next morning to check how they're healing and to look for signs of infection. I truly feel that this practice is wonderful and I would highly recommend them to anyone. Not just for their incredible pricing, but for how I felt I was treated by all the staff there. It is a busy practice and it is expected that there will be waits, but never did I feel that I was just another number. I paid $2090 for both eyes for uncomplicated PRK plus $200 for medications as of July 2016.

They run tests on your eyes to test your suitability and candidacy. I checked out both and found PLEC to be rushed and kind of hectic. The technicians were unfriendly and detached. Not once did they smile or explain to me what they were doing. I had to ask what they were doing and felt like they couldn't be bothered with my questions.

", "On the day of surgery, the actual procedure is less than 10 minutes. They put a ring in your eye to hold your eyes open and freezing drops to ensure you don't feel any pain. You won't feel a thing when they're zapping your eyes. You will smell something like burnt rubber or burnt hair, which is the smell of your cornea being burned off. The doctor tells you to look at the flashing red or green light and that's all you do. Before you know it, the procedure is over.

PRK is generally more preferred since it doesn't run the risk of flap complications, and there are less limitations to the types of activities you can do.

I ended up personally calling the surgeon to see me immediately on a Sunday, and he saw me within the next hour. I was impressed at his care and prompt response, and grateful that nothing serious happened to my eyes. He prescribed me Lumigan, a glaucoma eye drop, to lower the pressure, and I was fine! I now have a fantastic set of long eye lashes, which is the main side effect of the drug, haha =)", "Also be careful to not put in too many drops in your eyes. I apparently put in too much lacri-lube gel in my eyes, that it was clogging my tear ducts, which is not good. So don't make the same mistakes that I did.

Although, I want to point out that both clinics have impressive stats and high success rates, so both clinics may be just as good.

However, on the surgery date, when I was having my prescription checked, as the optometrist (if she even is an optometrist, I later found out she only has a Dip. in Optom.) was switching between the different lenses, the unit was shaking so much that it was difficult for me to see through it and tell her what I could see. Fortunately, they did another check on my prescription with someone else, so that eased my anxiety a little. The surgery went fine and was done by Dr. Kirzner. I had PRK. However, the information packet they gave me was not very clear as they had to substitute out some of the drugs and some of the instructions were conflicting (i.e. one piece of paper would say use every night until finished while another would say use as needed). Some of the instructions also conflicted with the actual instructions on the drugs themselves (i.e. some of the eye drops were single use but was told by CHEC to keep using the same vial until I was done). This confusion was not stress that I wanted to have after my surgery as I wasn't sure whose instructions I should follow. In addition, a few weeks after surgery, I developed high pressure in my eyes so I needed to get some other medication to lower the pressure. Having high pressure in the eyes can cause blindness if the pressure stays too high so this caused further anxiety and stress for me. But all that time and the follow up appointments, I was seen by the lady who has a Dip. in Optom. and not Dr. Kirzner himself. I had requested to see Dr. Kirzner and even took a day off from work in order to do so, but when I was called into the appointment room, it was still not Dr. Kirzner but another gentleman. All in all, I felt that the after surgery care was poor, and with the threat of losing my sight when my pressure was too high (it is fine now) I would have gladly taken back my glasses and contact lenses in exchange.

When I explained that I live out of town, she told me that if I didn't come in, my warranty would be voided. \u00a0I explained that I would be able to come in 4 weeks from the surgery, and possible again 8 weeks, depending on how my work was. \u00a0She told me that was insufficient and that would negate my warranty - all of this was new to me, and when I booked the surgery, the lady who booked it assured me that is was OK that I wouldn't be able to make every appointment because of the distance. \u00a0", "We moved past that and I tried to book my 4 week check-up, only to learn that NO ONE works on Monday. \u00a0NO surgical staff would be available to check my eyes. \u00a0Now bells were really going off. \u00a0I still proceeded to change my schedule to make the 4 weeks work and go back into the waiting room.", "I then had two more people test my eyes and then Dr. K comes in. \u00a0Wow, what a piece of work this guy is. \u00a0Comes in, stares at the floor, TALKS to the floor, never once made eye contact, reviews my chart and starts talking to the floor about the procedure. \u00a0I understand that he has done this spiel 1,000 times, but it's the first time I'm hearing it, I would like to hear what you're saying, I am sure the floor doesn't care. \u00a0At that moment I decided this was NOT the place for me and I hightailed it outta there. \u00a0I ended up going to London Eye Center (same day) and they fit me into their schedule and I had my eyes done. \u00a0They are warm, understanding, they took the time to explain the procedure (turns out that the tissue sparing I was suppose to receive at Coal Harbour would have increased my chance at regression by 7% because my astigmatism was so high, something that Coal Harbour DIDN'T explain) and made me feel like a person, not just a number going through the machine. \u00a0Obviously Coal Harbour's model works for a lot of people, but for me it was not an experience I would ever like anyone to go through!"]},

I was curious, as I am an avid contact wearer and would have preferred to leave my contacts in til the morning of, but I wanted my surgery to go well and I knew a lot of it relied on me. My research shows that contacts actually change the shape of the eye and to get the proper info for your surgery at the pre-operation exam, they need your eyes to be as much in their natural state as possible. I dont think that the repurcussions are dire, but I read some notes online from people that had *cheated* and they either had to have subsequent *touch up* surgeries (this is not necessarily because of the contact wear) or didnt think they saw as well as they really were supposed to. I was tempted to cheat between the pre-op and surgery dates- even got permission to wear my contacts for a very short period of time, but decided against it as I just wanted the best possible experience and ultimately, bang for my buck. no one knows just how much contact wear will adjust your eye shape, so its a risk.

I have a friend who's eye sight was at a -1.75 or something and because they werent so bad to begin with, and the healing process with PRK kinda takes you to a bad place in terms of blurriness, cloudiness and discomfort, this can be discouraging and scary for some people who dont see the benefit and improvement right away.

Having had multiple crowns and root canals etc., this is by far one of my best dental visits. \u00a0And, I despise spending money on dentists so four star rating from me is a high accomplishment from any dentist. \u00a0", "Dr. Chum showed me the decay and reviewed the procedure in a sufficient manner to make me comfortable with both the procedure and costs and while we waited for the crown to cool, he filled my other tooth which also had a filling (done less than a year ago by Kassam) fall out. \u00a0FYI - I was eating ice-cream at the time - soft - no sticky stuff - no hard stuff. \u00a0I digress. \u00a0What's important, is that Dr. Chum measured the crown and showed me his process AND when he fit it in, PRACTICLY NO ADJUSTMENT. \u00a0To me, this is a huge talent and I've only had two dentists who were ever able to do this (sadly, I've had multiple crowns due to my strong jaw and grinding). \u00a0I've deliberately written this review the next day and I am in virtually no pain so far. \u00a0He'd adjusted the drugs in my jaw and I'd say that all factors considered, I am painfree in a day - whereby it usually takes a week to feel better after a deep excavation and crown! \u00a0I'd say reasonably priced for the skill and kindness and comfort level and convenience and mostly the skill.", "That said, I'd highly recommend both Irina, who was the dental assistant and Dr. Chum as the dentist."]},

Since its opening back in May I have gone for a total of four floats, each a little bit better than the last. If you're new to floating, Float House offers an intro pack which offers three 90-minute sessions at a discounted rate. Since there is a bit of a learning curve, I'd encourage any first-timers to bite the bullet and get the 3-pack. You won't regret it.", "There are many different and valid reasons that people become float fanatics. For me, it's an opportunity to spend some quality time with myself in an environment where there are absolutely no distractions. The float tank enables you to forget the physical world and explore your mind and consciousness. This helps with relaxation, stress-relief, enhances creativity and a sense of connectedness to something bigger than yourself (among many other amazing qualities).", "A few tips for first-timers:", "1. Don't expect anything to \"happen.\" People often have the expectation that they are going to have a crazy psychedelic experience, and are then disappointed when it doesn't happen. Although this is possible, I've found that when you go into it with that expectation, you put too much pressure on yourself and therefore it doesn't happen naturally.", "2. This one was a big one for me: if you're a meditator, don't try to meditate. Focusing on techniques (whatever they may be) tends to stifle the experience. If your mind wants to wander -let it! It's fascinating what you can learn if you just let your mind take you for a ride.", "3. This one comes from my boyfriend: don't go when you're super well-rested. I find that you need to be right in that Goldilocks zone of being not too sleepy, but not too awake either. If you're too well-rested, you tend to get a bit shifty and therefore unable to get comfortable in the experience.", "4. If you find your shoulders or neck are a bit achy, try keeping your hands palms facing upwards, above or at head-level. This keeps your shoulders back and your chest open, which for me is much more comfortable after 60+ minutes in the tank.", "5. Don't plan to do anything after your float. I find that floating induces a state of euphoria and enhanced creativity, so I personally like to bring a journal or something to write down any ideas that I came up with during the experience. It seems like a real shame if you had to run off to work or something else after. Give yourself time to enjoy!", "6. For all the hippies-at-heart out there (you know who you are), try booking an appointment during a new moon or full moon for an extra treat.", "The only reason that I knocked off a star is because I really wish there was some kind of lounge area in the back where people could relax afterwards without being so close to the hecticness of the street. Personally, I always run off to a nearby tea shop to relax, but it would be much better if I could stay on site. Also, as a girl who fancies a blow-dry at the end of her float, it's a bit awkward to dry my hair in the common area. ", "I'm sure there are many more tips that I could write, but I should probably keep this to a readable length. Please don't hesitate to message me if you have any questions.

However I must say the reception was very courteous and explained the process thoroughly. The place has a very calming atmosphere that I enjoyed. The first 15min my neck was sore because my body was trying to adjust to the buoyancy. Then I had to step out for shower in between which is NOT recommended because inevitably the salt in your hair will fall down to your face and into your eyes..... STINGS! A newbie mistake. When I went back to the tank (I didn't close the tank completely) I actually fell asleep until the music started to play. I was secretly worried that I would fall asleep so deep that somebody has to wake me up while I am naked. I am sure everyone thought of this? Thankfully this did not occur and I was happily out on time. It's a very subjective experience which was worth trying."]},

I was advised by a nurse that I may need to be induced and then handed an informational pamphlet. This pamphlet described only the first stage of induction; a fairly simple, pretty painless-souding procedure to induce dilation. I was not told how induction continues from there; that it often ultimately requires pitocin, which typically results in exceptionally painful contractions and often ends up requiring an assisted delivery or a C-section anyway. I fortunately learned this much on my own, but was left with the distinct impression that important information was intentionally being withheld from me at the hospital.", "That was far from the worst of it. As it turned out, I went into labour on my own, but my experience was nonetheless a nightmare. My baby went into distress just as the pushing stage began, and an OB - Dr Robert Anderson - was called in. Without any consultation with me or my husband about my risks or options, the OB used \"high\" forceps to rotate and then pull my baby through the full length of the birth canal. Not too surprisingly, the doctor had difficulty getting him out: several late-term ultrasounds had indicated he had a very large head, but this was of little interest to the doctor beforehand. My baby was seriously bruised and scratched on his head, requiring stitches next to his eye. And I... was a mess. I spent months in pain, hardly able to walk comfortably. And I continue to be very uncomfortable on my feet, nearly ten months out. I used to be a very active hiker and runner, but no more. I also get to look forward to many problems as I get older, due to the trauma my pelvic floor sustained from those forceps. ", "Fortunately my baby has recovered much better than I have; in this regard I can consider myself lucky. Childbirth is always full of unpredictibilities, but these \"high\" forceps are *well known* to cause serious injury to the mother, and sometimes the baby as well. In any reasonable hospital (and every single hospital in the U.S., where I am now living), C-section has long been considered a far safer alternative for a distressed baby still high in the birth canal, and high forceps have been banned. St Paul's should reconsider its policy regarding the use of this type of forceps. Their continued use is in total disregard to the well-being and quality of life of their maternity ward patients."]},

It's hard, yes, and we get some of the sickest patients in the province. We do all the heart transplants. We are the HIV AIDS centre. We get high risk births. We serve the DTES. St Paul's is an amazing place. It's falling to bits and pieces, yes, but still I love it.

Before you point the finger, remember that we are one of BCs magnet hospitals... and we service the DTES. It's not always happy times.", "I am a RN. During my time at St P's, I have been called every name under the sun, been spat on, kicked, punched, scratched, had urine and feces thrown at me and hurt myself trying to save another person's life (to name a few things), all while spending time away from my loved ones. Remember, it's not M-F, 9-5. It's Sundays, it's Christmas, it's Saturday nights. It's all the time. Nurses work non-stop. We are there all the time. So when you come in the door to Emerg and someone is short with you, try to let it roll off your back. You would probably be in a bad mood too if someone just threw poop at you and called you a #$#&$. It's no excuse for bad behaviour, I agree. But the flip side is that maybe that grumpy nurse or doctor just spent two hours doing CPR on a 30 year old woman who didn't make it. A lot goes on at St Paul's. A lot that the public does not see. Sometimes it's hard to turn around and smile at the new person walking in the door when you just dealt with such adversity.", "A lot of people bellyache about the building. I especially love the review from the US patient. Yes, it's not even remotely glamorous and there is no WIFI. And yes, the TVs are ridiculous. But last time I checked, you weren't there to catch up on emails or X Factor. That CCU bed costs upwards of 10000 per DAY. Yes, it's true. So smile, get a book and be happy that we spend your tax dollars on top notch doctors, well trained nurses and cutting edge medical equipment - not curtains and flat screen TVs. Plus, given it's St Paul's, it would just get stolen anyway. You may be surprised to know that we have US citizens paying out of pocket to come to St Paul's for our cutting edge procedures that they can't get in America. This isn't the gravy train, it's damn good health care. And if you want fancy rooms with designer decor, please feel free to spend your life savings at a US hospital so you can relax in style. Complaining about the hospital decor will get you one thing and one thing only - increased taxes. You choose.", "The food is gross. I agree. I am constantly apologizing to patients and advising family to bring in food. Again, since food is now privately contracted, the hospital has little control. Maybe write your local MLA?", "Given that, St Paul's has some of the nicest and most competent nurses and doctors I have ever worked with. I am proud of the care we give there. I know there are goofs, I work with them! But they are everywhere. If I needed anything, I would be there in a heart beat. I love the place and will always be proud to say I work there."]},

I needed one or the other just to get through the day, otherwise I'd be blind. My main irritation was that if I wore contacts for more than eight hours, my eyes would get really dry and sore and I would have to take them out, so if I wanted to wear them during the day, I couldn't wear them at night and vice versa. One of my friends recommended this clinic to me after he had the procedure done and I was crazy jealous that he could see. ", "I made an appointment, went in for a FREE consultation, where they do about 8 eyeball tests on you and put drops in your eyes that make them all sensitive to light and it takes up to three hours. After that, they let you know if you are a candidate for lasik or PRK. These are the two different types of surgery for your eye. Lasik, as I understand is when they cut and flip your eyeball and it heals very quickly, however to have this procedure done, you need to have a lot of eye tissue and I did not. Thus I had to opt for the more expensive version, which takes about a week to heal. Luckily for me, the clinic also offers financing! I was able to put down about $300 and then be put on a plan to finance for two years at about $100/month. ", "The day of the surgery came, and I can honestly say that I was a nervous wreck, I totally have the eyeball fear, and it seemed like every time I turned around during the week leading up to the surgery there was something on TV or some story I was being told about someone's eyeball getting stabbed or poked or prodded. Even the episode of the Simpsons was on where Homer gets eye surgery and his eyeballs crust over! Lucky for me, they gave me an adavan before I had to go in, I think I probably could have used two, but the doctors know best right? They also redid a few of the eye tests just to confirm the information that they took when I came in for the consultation. Also, ladies take note, you are not allowed to wear eye makeup for three days prior to the surgery, and no contacts for a week! ", "I waited in the waiting room for over half an hour with my friend who was going to sit in the recovery room where they have a TV and you can actually watch the surgery. GROSS! We had been at the clinic so long already that he had to step outside to plug the parking meter. As soon as he stepped out the door, I was called into the surgery room. They laid me down on a bed and put this crazy machine-thing over my face and started the procedure, it's pretty weird to be awake through it. You are told to look straight ahead at the red light and then they laser your eyeballs and throw in some clear contacts lenses for protection. The procedure is so quick that I was finished by the time my friend got back upstairs from plugging the meter, so it was less than five minutes for both eyes. It did smell like burnt hair after they did the surgery... which was obviously the smell of burnt eyeball. EEEWW!! I sat in recovery for a bit and for a little while I could see, but it was very blurry, they gave me about five or six different eye-drops to use in 30 minute intervals over the next week, and a week's worth of adavan, woohoo! They also gave me the cel number of the surgeon who did the procedure in case I had any overnight pain or bleeding, which was very uncommon, but just incase, which gave me a lot more reassurance that I was in good hands. I had to come back the next morning so they could make sure everything was A-OK, and it was, so I just kept on putting eye-drops in until a week went by and I had to come in and they took the protective contact lenses out, it wasn't until after this point that my eyes really started to heal and I could start to see again. So remember to BE PATIENT! Your eyes will also be very light sensitive for a while after the surgery, but that will pass as time goes by as well. ", "Overall, I think the staff at the clinic know what they are doing and do their best to make sure you are taken care of. They tell you exactly what is going to happen all the way through the procedure and how you will feel and will be able to answer all of your inquiries in a professional manner. I would highly recommend this procedure and this business to anyone."]},

Dr. Tom and Tuyet (I hope I spelled her name right!) are my faves... I will only see them. I have managed to avoid the dentist for almost 10 years because I have major anxiety about needles in my mouth. I'm 34 and have never had a cavity. I was recommended to them from a girl at my work, so I decided to go because I was way overdue! Everyone was so friendly! They answered all my questions and didn't make fun of me or judge me for my fears. I tend to be quite s talker and ask a lot if questions. The only time I felt I may have been asking too much was when I was talking about something, probably way off topic, and out if the corner of my eye I saw the assistant looking at him and pointing at her watch... Dr. Tom is so friendly and funny that he is totally someone I would probably have fun hanging out in real life with.... But I know I talk too much at times! I ended up having 2 chipped teeth that needed to be filled, and one cavity. Dr. Tom was so good! I swear I barely felt the needles and he had to put them way up in the back if my mouth, and even in my cheek. He had a lot if funny banter going on with his assistant which was calming. Everytime I come in ,Tuyet will poke her head in and say \"hi\". It's nice to be remembered somewhere where you feel very vulnerable and scared, but the people working there are so kind and don't just treat you like someone they are making money off of. I've sent a few people in to see them also... Even my boyfriend who is TERRIFIED of dentists. He ended up having to get many cavities and root canals, and Dr. Tom even did a shiny white gold tooth for one of his front top teeth. This place is so good for anyone who is scared of the dentist! I recommend Tuyet and Dr. Tom Karkanis! I'm sure everyone is good, but I prefer to see the same people."]},

It was a very hot day and we wanted to be cool (literally) and relax. This time the ventilation did seem as if it had improved. I tend to just fall asleep inside of the chamber.

I definitely leave feeling relaxed however I don't experience the same meditative or cathartic sentiments that others may feel, judging from the guestbook entries that I've read in the lounge area. My boyfriend and I still have several floats left in our package and I'm sure we will use them. The last two times that we have gone it has been spontaneous. We just decided \"Hmm what to do... I feel like going for a float. let's do it.\" The second time we went they had two different Earplug options which is good, because last time I went the foam earplugs did not work very well for me. The wax ones that they now have were definitely a more comfortable option. If you have any cuts or skin irritation the salt water will not feel good on it. And it does not feel good to get that salt water in your eyes either so be warned. The facility itself is clean and has a good energy. So there you have it! That's my review. Try it out for yourself.

The controller is a colour gradient wheel, so literally, any colour you can dream up, you can have it as your mood lighting. I chose a soft Magenta purple, while my float partner chose a vivid green. The float rooms are quite spacious, with a large open concept shower all tiled in a soft greyblue. The water pressure is wonderful, and you don't run out of hot water! They supply you with a pre float wash, a post float wash and hair conditioner. After you shower off with the pre float wash, its time to thoroughly dry off, and put in your ear plugs (they supply them to you). After you assess the tank (which to be honest, is incredibly daunting) its time to open the hatch and climb in. They suggest that you keep a towel handy at all times to dry you ears, or dry any water that makes its way near your eyes (800lbs of Epsom salts stings like a b*tch when it gets in your eyes). After climbing into the tank, its a quick reach up for the door hatches handle, and the motion of closing the tank forces your body forwards, and you slip into the natural floating position. The air inside the tank was quite dense and muggy, so I kept my hatch open for about five minutes to air it out, then closed it. Total silence and darkness.. what a treat!

Before I even had a chance to correct him, he started telling me about all of my \"test results\", which were another patient's test results. When I finally got a word in and told him he was mistaken, he looked confused and told me that \"the computer told him\" that I was Patient X. After the misunderstanding was cleared, he said that because I was late and went to the bathroom, I actually missed my 15-minute appointment slot, and we only had 2 minutes left together, as Patient X was waiting in the other room. I was so taken aback and speechless, I asked whether I should just leave and make another appointment for another day.

When I made the appointment over the phone and was asked about the reason for my visit, I noted that I've been having difficulty breathing (for many months, but it got worse when I moved to Vancouver). He saw the phrase \"shortness of breath\" on his computer, told me it was possible a serious medical emergency, and that I should just go to the ER. Again, I was so shocked, I said that it's something I've been experiencing for a while, and that I was pretty sure it wasn't an actual emergency that needed urgent care. My previous family doctor scheduled a lung capacity test, but I moved to BC before my appointment time came up. He told me that the ER could take care of everything, and I should go there. Then with a shrug he just got up, ran out and went to his next appointment. The entire time he seemed completely out of it.", "I went to the front desk and complained to the staff that this was *not* an actual medical appointment by any means, and that I do not want this appointment to be billed to the province. I would have to find a different clinic and different doctor, because the 2 minutes I spent with this unprofessional doctor led to no actual examination, no conversation and no medical advice other than the horrible and incorrect advice to \"just go to the ER\". Another doctor came to see what was happening, and told me that the clinic has a policy to stick to its 15-minute time limit, that I should respect that and \"take my upset feelings and decide how to proceed forward.\" I proceeded forward by going to the Khatsalano clinic, getting an actual doctor, being prescribed an inhaler (for what turned out to be mild asthma), and now posting on Yelp to warn others NOT TO GO TO THIS CLINIC."]},

Every doctor has a different technique that they like to use which is why I like to try out different places every so often. I switched from my last doctor as I wanted to try someone new. Spruce Body Lab is just a block away from me and I've walked past it a number of times, so I decided to book an appointment. While Spruce Body Lab is pristine and looks beautiful, it does have a 'laboratory' feel to it. I didn't feel 'cozy' here if that makes sense. I'm sure there are people that feel different, I guess it's just based on personal opinion. Reception was nice but some of the girls working at the front desk had a 'fake nice' persona. It didn't feel genuine and was overdone. The first time I got came here, the doctor (they didn't tell me his name and I didn't bother to ask later on as I didn't think I would return) wasn't very pleasant and was difficult to talk to. He did what he thought would look good and not exactly what I wanted. I want to say that he didn't do a bad job. It was good IF you want natural, subtle results but I wanted more of a dramatic look. He was very conservative and did what he though would look good instead of what I wanted. I wasn't asking for anything crazy, just something that looked more dramatic than a natural looking change. I don't understand why some doctors won't give someone a more artificial look just because they like more natural results. At the end of the day, this is your clients face and shouldn't you give them what they want? I wasn't being unreasonable. I went to a different doctor at a different medi spa to get a touch up 3 weeks later. A considerable amount of time went by and I decided to try out Spruce again. Dr. Pavlou was my doctor this time and he was amazing. He gave me exactly what I wanted and I couldn't be any happier! He knows what he is doing and he does it very well. I left satisfied with my results. I've visited Dr. Pavlou since then. I recently tried out a different medi spa for a few skin treatments and found out Dr. Pavlou works there too. Turns out, he works at multiple places which I think is great because that way you have a choice of where you see him. The next time I choose to get my injectables from him, I will most likely go to one of the other places he works at. The reason for this is because I didn't feel 'at home' at Spruce. It's nothing personal, it just wasn't for me. Overall, Spruce Body Lab is a good place. I would recommend trying it out as everyone is different and while I may not have loved it here, there are other people who do. It all comes down to personal preference."]},

No actually I was trying to help you redeem your business and give you the benefit of the doubt. He went on this long tangent about his business was not focused on customer service like other spas but more on community involvement, whatever that means? He also told me that groupon takes so much of his money that he doesn't want to honor them and he makes no money. Why has this business signed up so many times for groupon then? He went on for a good 10 minutes about this. He then went on to say has so many prestige loyal customers and his business is so popular and thriving he does not need groupon or other voucher services or other customers.

They were questions regarding the type of massage you want, any tension on your body you wanna focus on, how much pressure, allergies and if you have any skin or medical conditions.

It was dim lit with calming music playing in the background, my type of sanctuary. So me and my girl friend choose the foot massage instead of the facial because we were wearing a full face of make up.. (oops. we should've known) They left us to get prep first. Theres two baskets that you can put your stuff in to keep it all in one place. You lay and then you wait for them.", "About the massage, i only remember my leg part and when she asked for me to flip over because i actually fell asleep while she was doing my back (my friend did too LOL) I only woke up when she massaged my foot because i was very ticklish (again, i should've known). That's how calming it was..", "After the whole experience, she whispered that that was the end of the session and to take our time getting dressed. I was actually so tempted to take her up on her offer and just sleep for a bit more haha but we still had plans afterwards so we shook it off and got dressed. While paying for the taxes + tip, they also mentioned that they have a make up station where you can fix your make up! How cool is that? !", "I felt so pampered that day! Only reason that threw me off with that one star is the wait time for us to get an appointment. I believe i called them to get an appointment back in Jan or Feb?

To me, 3 stars is a solidly positive if not glowing recommendation.

I may have been a little more surly in my tone than usual when I wrote the review, partly because I had just started a new job that involved long hours and a crazy long commute so my window of time to do anything besides commute or work was nearly nothing. In that situation you become extraordinarily protective of those scarce windows of time you have left between travel, work and home obligations, and yes you might (by which I mean *I did*) develop a sort of maniacal and militant protectionist posture when someone even accidentally takes some of the one commodity you desperately need more of. You might even (irrationally) feel like you've been robbed. ", "So... was I tough on Mount Pleasant Optometry? I still don't think so. Have I considered going back and giving them an opportunity to make things right? Well not really, and not because I still harbor resentments or even care about what happened 4 years ago, but because when I recently got new glasses someplace else, \u00a0I had such an exceptionally lovely service experience that I'll probably just keep going to that lovely experience place until I don't have a lovely experience there any more or I move, or whatever. That's the price and reward of good service. ", "So, now you're wondering, \"why the heck is she \u00a0revising her review then?\" ", "Right?", "I'm revising my review because although I haven't been back to the clinic as a patient since my last experience, I *have* accompanied two other people there and *they* had good experiences and they aren't going to tell you about it, because they're not Yelpers. ", "Last year I helped a friend choose a new pair of glasses at MPOC, and the young woman doing the fitting was highly professional and seemed to really know what she was doing. She was extremely thorough in checking the fit of the frames, measuring things and making notes and had some good pointers about which frames might work or not with her face. I appreciated her courteous, professional, and competent service and my friend got a GORGEOUS pair of well fitting glasses, which presumably arrived on time and all. The do have a great selection of luxury frames in stock for such a small clinic. ", "Another time I was at Mount Pleasant Optometry, I was accompanying my sister and my niece when my little niece was having her eyes checked. I was truly amazed at how great Dr Ho was with this tiny squirmy human and how she was able to be kind, but focused on the task at hand, and created an atmosphere that was engaging and not at all frightening. And let's be honest - often times the hardest part about working with kids is dealing with their parents - \u00a0Dr. Ho was great with my sister too who can sometimes be a tiny bit helicopter-ish.

We explained the urgency for the glasses and was advised that they would rush the order and Mt Pleasant would contact us to get the glasses on either on 2 or 3 May 2012.

By then, he gave up and asked me to follow up instead.", "I left a voice mail and heard from Mt Pleasant within an hour on 7 May 2012. When we went to get the glasses, we met a rude receptionist, who did not even bother to ask us why we were there when we got into the centre (there was only one other customer who was also sitting and waiting) and just told us to sit and wait. Although the centre closes at 6:30 pm, she switched off the air-condition at 6:20 pm even though there were customers still sitting in the reception area. It got stuffy and I decided to wait for my husband along the street outside the centre.", "My husband finally got his glasses on 7 May 2012 (at least 3 days after the promised date with much effort on our part) and the optician (a lady) did a pretty good job fitting the glasses. ", "Our Mt Pleasant experience was not so pleasant thanks to the unpleasant receptionist and the fact that nobody apologized for the fact that our urgent request was overlooked. Would I recommend the place? I would if the rude receptionist is not there and if they at least have the decency to acknowledge the oversight instead of just pretending that they have not disappointed us in any way."]},

She did a thorough job in every step, making sure my face was entirely covered and gave a great scalp and arm massage. Did I ever tell you how much I love scalp massages? She warned me beforehand that my face might get tingly with the peel, but it wasn't as bad as I was thought it would be. ", "The place itself is very cute and very tiny. There are 3 pedicure spots, one room for facial/massage/etc. Even though it's very small, I adore the pretty decor and they seem to utilize the space very well."]},

I could also see the topcoat on my nails since she didn't paint that all the way to the cuticle either. My previous manicures at other places did not look like that. My friend who also got a manicure did not have the space between the cuticles so maybe I just had an inexperienced manicurist. The whole treatment lasted about an hour so I don't know what the other review I read on this place said it was a 2 hour treatment. Maybe because more people started to come in and they only spend more time on you if no one else is there. The total was $40, so that was average. However I cannot comment on their other services since I only got the manicure. Overall I wouldn't come back for a manicure but maybe because the massage was so great, I'd try that."]},

I looked at the time when she left the room and it was just before 230pm, which means I could have been massaged for another 5 minutes.

The rooms are sparse but clean, and the beds are your standard massage tables. The heated blanket was a nice touch. William started out by spending about 15 minutes massaging my back and shoulders. Not overly involved, and definitely not conducive to any sort of relief from the shoulder tension I'd mentioned to him at the start when I said I had a headache. Then, he moved to my head - and that is where he stayed for the next 40 minutes. I'm not joking. \u00a0I mean, I love a head massage, but the complete lack of energy and resistance to massage anything except my head was bizarre.", "After a fair while of head work, I decided to tell him my head was sore - I really wanted the one handed scratching (he'd been texting for part of it) to stop. He asked me to turn over, and I thought I might actually get some of the rest of the \"FULL BODY MASSAGE\" I was paying for. Nope. He stayed on the head, doing the same motions he'd been doing for the prior 20-25 minutes. I know how long it was, as I snuck a look at the clock just as I rolled over. I was infuriated to see it was 8:40 (we'd started at 8:00) and that so far all I'd received was limited back work and a head scratch. No arms. No legs. No neck. No front of the shoulders. He rubbed my face for a bit between the next 15 minutes of on-my-back head scratching, and then we were done. I thanked him, changed, and walked to the reception. ", "I left extremely frustrated. I was mad that the female corworkers were not considerate. I was mad William was so nice yet so lacking in effort. I was mad I only received a 15 minute back rub with a 40 minute head scratch. I was mad I felt WORSE than when I walked in (probably from clenching my teeth/ tensing my shoulders throughout the whole 55 minutes). And I was mad I still tipped - albeit only just over 15%. ", "I'll NEVER go back. And I get massages at least once a month - more if I need it. Sure, it's cheap at $38, but so are many places: 55 minutes at my usual spot on Broadway and Cambie is only $42. And the next time my dear Mia at Golden Feet is not available, I will save my hard earned cash and wait until she is. So grateful for her - even more so now."]},

The young lady at the front desk took my information and promptly told me my Care Card wasn't valid. I would have to pay the private fee. This was impossible, I thought.

My tax paperwork was in order to reflect this and everything. There was no reason I was being denied. As a young person new in Vancouver I certainly could not afford to pay the private fee. The lady could not offer me any reason or help. I was feverish, sick to my stomach, teeming with bacteria, and humiliated. I reluctantly paid the fee with my partner's credit card (at this point I saw Dr. Morten who is a gem. Very knowledgeable and friendly. Highly recommend this gentleman!)

They advised me to contact the clinic and have them seek to refund what I had paid, though I was told it would take quite some time to process. So I did. I spoke to the same incompetent woman who told me she would take it up with her supervisor. He would be the one to arrange my reimbursement through MSP. Great, \u00a0I thought. It's fixed. It'll take awhile, but I'll get the money back (that I should never have been made to pay in the first place).", "Nope.", "After months of waiting, I contacted MSP to see how much longer I should expect this to take. They said they knew nothing. There was nothing to show the clinic had done anything. Again, they advised me to contact the clinic. So, I called and retold this exhausting story again. The clinic said they would look into it and I should expect a call back in a few days time. They never called back. Sick of waiting, I went in person. This is where I met the charming Dr. Budai. ", "I am proud to say that, having been in customer service for five years, I am patient, amiable, and try to treat people with respect. I was looking for help. I was under the impression the desire to help people is why people go into medicine in the first place. Apparently not Dr. Budai. After questioning why I was never contacted or reimbursed, Budai told me my file still says my MSP is not valid. Anyway, the time limit to receive reimbursement was over. There was no way I could get my money back now. Why was I never told this? I was told that you were arranging the compensation or I would have been actively pursuing the matter. Why the disparity between what MSP tells me and the information your clinic has? Dr. Budai shut down every one of my queries with short, annoyed answers. It was as if my problems bored him. He rolled his eyes at me. He was blatantly condescending and I felt completely taken advantage of. I am a strong young woman and can stick up for myself, but after the short conversation with Dr. Budai, I went into the hallway and cried. ", "Hence this scathing review.

SOLD! Despite being very last minute in calling in for an appointment (think less than a few hours ahead of time), they still managed to squeeze me in. Upon arrival, I was promptly greeted by the receptionist and asked to fill out a form, and despite being over 15 minutes early for my appointment they managed to get me into one of their massive massage couches with a hot tea in hand almost immediately. This being my first time getting a foot massage, I had cluelessly decided to wear skinny jeans to my appointment, but I guess that sort of thing happens pretty regularly because without skipping a beat my masseuse whisks me away to a back laundry area and produces a pair of loose fitting capri pants to wear. So now we're finally ready for the massage part lol this lady was a miracle worker! I wish I had caught her name, but she was a godsend. All in all I think she found about 3-4 tension knots in my feet and calves alone and she made sure to pay special attention to those areas to work out the kinks. After the glorious first 50 minutes were done, I followed her into the body massage room and crawled under the covers onto a heated bed and she went right to work. Perfect amount of pressure, didn't talk much, and I'm pretty sure I passed out at one point which is basically the best compliment I can give a massage lol 10/10 best massage experience I've ever had, including expensive ($300+) massages at fancy hotels, and I plan on returning this weekend for some more r&r.

We were lead downstairs to a lounge where there was juice, coffee, teas and chaise lounge chairs in a dimly lit room which was meant to be relaxing but felt.....old as the hotel has been there for sometime. We were then asked to come upstairs to do our manicures however it was on top floor which was 3 flights of stairs up which they don't mention to you over the phone when you book. I am unfortunately not in shape so getting up the stairs was a bit of a challenge and would be for anyone with knee issues or that is of an elderly age. Once we were upstairs, we were seated to do our mani's but there are no side by side tables and everything feels kinda cramped. All is all the $100 for a gel manicure (tax&tip) was NOT worth it especially since I couldn't sit beside my friend and chat and that is part of the fun when you are doing that with a friend, its supposed to be an experience not a chore. I wouldn't return. The only plus was really the light chicken salad that was offered which we didn't partake in as we were going out for lunch before shopping.

In addition, I told the girl that I like massages with a lot of pressure, and knowing that it is a spa and the girl was not an RMT, I didn't expect it to match that level of pressure. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it was. It's definitely not a deep tissue massage by any measure, but she did try very hard, and I did relax a lot and really enjoy it. At one point I almost fell asleep. Perhaps the only thing was that her movements were a little rushed. With longer, slower strokes, it would have been perfect. The bed was comfortable and clean, the product was fantastic, and the service was a very pleasant surprise, and I had fairly high expectations going in because of the good experience I had with the pedicure before.

I felt not enough time was spent on my neck/head. The stones were warm at best, and I personally like my stones really hot. I found the room on the chilly side which makes it hard to relax. Also it was quite loud from the surrounding businesses and I could hear rap music most of the time (not the most relaxing genre haha).

I have been to so many massage places, western or Chinese, you name it, but none of them really helped me with my lower back pain. But this one was so different. The guy who helped me with my massage actually taught me how to breathe when he was doing the acupressure massage on me. I did some research afterwards, and I believed that's what's so called \"QI GONG\". I don't know how that works, but the only thing I can tell you is it felt great afterwards. My back felt a little bit sore the second day, but after that, my pain went away. It was amazing. And two of my friends had foot massages that day, they said it was great as well. The rooms are very clean and tidy. The massage tables are comfortable. We will definitely come back again."]},

I immediately went into to speak with her and show her. She had not seen this reaction before and said that she would follow up, research if I had been given a bad batch of Kenlog and let me know what the next steps were. She never followed up. Weeks went by and I didn't hear anything and after reading and doing my own research I now know that Kenalog often causes atrophy and holes in the muscle, which she never advised me as her patient about. There are many class actions over the misuse of this drug. I followed up with the doctor twice following my situation and I have never received an answer or help from her. The most she suggested was trying an injection saline solution to reduce the dimples in my back, which I would have to pay for.

After 5 times of gong to hospital, she was finally assigned a nurse to follow-up with her to make sure she doesn't end up back in the hospital. \u00a0It was very ineffective. \u00a0The follow up nurse simply didn't follow-up on what she was supposed to do. \u00a0Things like following through on tests and to sort out her medicine, I had to call and remind her constantly and even then it wasn't effective. \u00a0What bothers me the most is lack patient phone in the wards. There is one portable phone in some wards and sometimes nurses answering the phones state that it's for the doctor's use only. \u00a0Patients should be able to speak to their family members, emotional well-being helps their overall health as well their recovery. \u00a0This is a very basic need, even prisoners have access to phone, why not patients?", "An update on this review, my mom was admitted to emergency and even though she had a severe pain, Dr. Horach, the emergency Doctor refused to admit her. \u00a0I tried to explain to him that my mom can't follow up with her primary doctor due to her old age and condition, but the doctor was uncompromising and to be fair he said he's following procedures. \u00a0I'm lowering my rating to one star now, This was against and unlike the advise of other doctors that had admitted my mom for the exact same reason. \u00a0I guess procedures are variable based which the doctor who assesses your condition."]},

Not bad, but nothing outstanding either. I liked the cucumber slices they provide for your eyes and the eucalyptus spa. I didn't use the ozonated pool as it didn't seem very appealing.

I don't know what the masseuse' creds are, but I've have a few now that have acupuncture backgrounds as well as reflexology training. The massages are hard though, so if you're a lightweight, you need to let them know before they start and remind them along the way, they sometimes forget. Apparently the harder the better. The body massage depends on the person giving it, I had Jackie and he was great! He starts off warming up the body by massaging through a bedsheet, then goes in deeper to the muscles using oil. I must admit massaging through a bedsheet is a little strange, but it works. The foot massage is 50 mins and you get neck and shoulder work for a few minutes first, then a hot foot soak followed by your massage."]},

But since the facialist had arrived I decided to do the facial anyway. I did not want a free facial, I just wanted the facial I had book and was willing to pay for. I didn't want my pride being hurt to stand in the way of finding a good facialist in Vancouver, so I did the facial. After the facial was done, I went to the front desk to pay, and I repeat I had every intention of paying, but the fact that they didn't bring up that they had previously offered me a free facial and acted like everything was alright and expected me to do so also or worst to bring it up as if I was some kind of thief, absolutely repulsed me. Granted I was fine with all this inconsideration if the facial itself had been good. ", " Secondly, I did not and could not enjoy the facial as a relaxing experience. I've been getting monthly facials for the last two years, I know how relaxing an experience they can be and how wonderful and clean you feel afterwords. The facialist at Juillet spa didn't wash her hands once, and she kept on touching my face, even after extractions she still did not wash her hands and touched my face constantly. The only thing in my mind was how dirty her hands were. I suppose you might call me fussy but never before in my last two years of monthly facials had I ever thought the facialist had dirty hands, not once. I also think that she had skipped breakfast, so for one entire hour I was engulfed in bad breath. Even though I felt like the facial was unhygienic, since I had never had an experience like it before I thought that if the results was good, then its okay.", " Finally the last and most important reason I think you should reconsider going is that they ruined my skin. I've always been quite vain about my skin, I have gotten numerous compliments on it all my life. I do break out but usually around my period and its only one pimple, or at most two..at most. Every time I get a facial it takes one week for my skin to glow again. When I visited Juillet spa exactly one week later I broke out into sever acne. Nothing had changed in my life or in my diet, and I also am not a teenager. I'm a twenty year old woman who has had nearly perfect skin all her life suddenly a week after my unhygienic facial broke out into disgustingly severe acne. I just stayed home and cried for a few days, my face didn't feel like itself, it was swollen, red and bumpy. I called my family doctor and she told me to visit the spa and ask for some kind of explanation. So I went hoping that they would tell me something assuring such as maybe all the acne under my skin was now atop and after they were gone I would have good skin again, or for them to say something of that kind. But instead they got defensive, thinking I was trying to get something from them. They kept on repeating over and over that this couldn't have been their fault, which my doctor assured me it was. When at last I managed to tell them that I had no intention of getting anything from them, then they calmed down and seemed to not even care at my distress. They tried to sell my some products and then they repeated that it must be my(fully grown) hormones. I then left with no form of assurance or apology, in fact the manager followed me out as if I was some kind of hoodlum. Anyway I wonder why my hormones didn't act up when I had visited other facialists, no apparently my hormones had waited all they life to meet the filthy facial of Juillet spa. Anyway if anyone experiences something similar, go immediately to your family doctor or dermatologist and within a week or two all the havoc that Juillet spa brought upon your skin will be cleared up ."]},

Just as you would expect, they soak your feet in medium warm water temperature that has a plastic liner for disposal afterward. They start at your forehead with a natural moisturizer and apply pressure toward temples, ear (pinna), and direct pressure at scalp. They apply more moisturizer and continue on each side of your neck with emphasis around your juggler vain shifting toward shoulder. By the time they transition to your feet, if you're anything like me, I am so ready to fall asleep. I wouldn't recommend if you're experiencing severe chronic back pain only for the main reason that no one here is licensed, this is more of a leisure massage to help polish off the edge and chase a few knots away.", "The store presents itself very clean and each sofa/foot chair has a new set of towels, blanket and replacement pillow with case as new session begins.

I like to wear shorts with a loose Nike sport top, baseball cap and flip flops.", "Management is very professional and friendly who remember your face and greet you with a warm smile.

The quality of the manicure itself: I have never walked out of Queen Nail with flawless nails, as it should be when you pay a professional to do what you yourself cannot, right? There is always at least 3 nails with gaps in the polish (around the cuticle bed) bubbling, or uneven surfaces. I am by no means an overly critical person, and I can understand some amount of human error, but Queen Nail leaves me with a manicure I felt I could have done at home on my own. Also, I am constantly having to oversee the manicure procedure to ensure the nails are shaped correctly, that there isn't excess cuticle left behind, and even to REMIND the staff of steps they have skipped over (cleaning under the nail with that scrapey tool should never be skipped, I don't care how busy you are.) ", "2. Atmosphere: I'm not entirely sure why there is a tranquil looking candle floating on a bed of rose petals in the photo, I have never seen such a thing at Queen Nail, not even remotely close. The salon features a huge neon lit up sign that assaults your eyes with various messages about their specials. The tables are crammed against the walls, the seats are uncomfortable, and the salon is constantly a mess. The equipment is dirty, and nothing has a luxurious or spa like feel to it.

She wasn't lazy, but either she had had zero grasp on quality of service and how overloads of clients can impede on it, or the business is disgustingly managed, and this is policy treatment. She spoke broken English and couldn't understand anything I wanted. I came on for acrylics and caved to her urges to get the UV Gel set. I wanted rounded, pointy nails and she ignored this and did square. \u00a0I wanted pink nails with gold sparkles on the ring finger. I got clear with gold extensions. I tried many times to tell her I didn't want her to do what she was doing but she didn't pay any attention. They then knocked on an extra $20 for a \"combo pedi\" for next time. No way. I had to make her take it off. When I came back 2 weeks later with cracked, peeling nails, she hacked at them with a nail extension and filed them straight down to the skin. They were paper thin and made everyday tasks very painful. \u00a0This business is criminal and should be shut down. Do not be fooled by the trendy building block or is located in. That is all."]},

At the time i didnt have insurance my adjustments were paid out of pocket but with only 2 adjustments i was much better.

A neurologist had recommended back surgery but we felt that was too drastic and risky a procedure.. I would highly recommend dr gonzales and his staff.

Occasionally I've had to reschedule an appt or been a teensy bit late but they have always been courteous and rescheduled the visit without a problem.

They gave me an adjustment and signed me up for month to month services Through My debit card and said that's the only way I can get services. I signed up for the month to month. And then an hour after I left there I had extreme excruciating pain. I ended up having to go to the urgent care. The following day I had to go to the emergency room. I was advised to cease and desist with all chiropractic care and get an MRI. I sent them a letter meaning I sent it to the chiropractor the joint letting them know I'm cancelling all my future services and please stop debiting my account and I explained why. They told me today they refused to stop debiting my account and instead of the receptionist signing me up for month to month service she signed me up for 6 months of services. They then told me they were going to continue to debit my account for 6 months even though I was telling them not to do this and that I sent a letter in writing cancelling. I \u00a0recommend you don't go to these people! They are con artist who were just trying to find ways to get money out of people for services you no longer want. I will also be writing a letter to the Better Business Bureau because they threatened me that if I stop the payments with my debit card they are going to send me to collections.

She did an outstanding job releasing the pressure points in my upper and lower extremities, but it was the foot massage that was the most mind blowing.

For once I didn't tense up because her healing energy and hands gave me permission to be vulnerable with her and let myself give in to the pain and pleasure of it all. In fact, I enjoyed my experience so much that I purchased five 60-minute foot massages for $100, with May! =)", "Even though there was a rowdy group of males outside that couldn't be ignored, the music was exactly what my mind needed to relax me. It was like an oriental lullaby. I will also say that the lights coulda been dimmer (they put a bean-bag eye mask on you), and the lotions applied could have been warmer (particularly after your feet have been soaking in warm-hot water). However, May was willing to accommodate and customize my massage according to my needs (pulling/stretching of my arms and legs; grinding the wooden stick on my feet).

I don't really mind the lack of privacy...I just tend to tune out the other people there. The place looked clean and the music and waterfall sounds were soothing. The only thing that bothered me was the outside noise coming in. For whatever reason, the receptionist left the front door open and loud cars and random kids playing and yelling were heard here and there. Also, the bright lighting at the front would slightly spill out into the main massage room, but I guess you just have to close your eyes and forget about it. The actual massage was good...not too hard and not too soft. It was your typical reflexology: you soak your feet in water (you can pay an extra $5 for them to add some scents or moisturizers in the bucket), they massage your body and feet. There's also a private massage area that is just separated by a curtain. I'm guessing that's if you pay for a different massage (maybe the $30 one that seems to be the popular choice). The only thing that I didn't like is that they didn't use any hot oil or stones. I've been to other reflexology places that do those extras little things for the same price. At the end, they give you a cup of water. Overall, it's a good place to try. Next time I go though, I'll try the $30 massage and compare the two."]},

Today I've had a bad headache for about 26 hours which start from neck/shoulder pain. I asked the front if I should do the regular $25 hour foot reflexology or the $30 combo. He said the combo because they would get the neck/shoulder area a bit better. I also knew that a lot of yelpers recommended the combo. I am so glad I did the combo! It started out as reflexology - laying out in the main room while she massaged my scalp and neck, arms, feet & legs. I was drifting off to sleep. It was wonderful. My personal preference is she could have given more pressure but I didn't say anything either. Then she asked me to go in the private room area. I'm not sure if it was a different person but this time the person was massage & hitting the knots in my shoulder/neck area. Next time I'm going to ask how much to add on extra time to focus on an area - my muscles are so tight. I think I will buy the 5 combo massages for $150 & get a 6th combo free.

Even average spas (and yoga studios and gyms and salons) provide body lotion and a towel drop in the change area.

Personally, even though the setting was perfectly delicious, I left frustrated by thirst and cleanliness issues and put off by staff and super-painful walkways.

Some people enjoy a bit of hustle and bustle and a bit more flexibility in the rules, while others, don't. ", "Personally, when I looked up Bota Bota spa, I was really hoping for that quiet, serene Nordic spa experience. Quiet in all the rooms, lots of space to relax between hot baths and cool dips, and a general sense of calm. Unfortunately, that's not what I found at Bota Bota. ", "First, the staff were not very helpful. The front staff seemed to assume we knew where we were going, despite asking us if we were first timers. She gave us vague directions and promised a tour once we found the white desk on the second floor. Once we checked in there, though, the staff seemed to ignore us once they confirmed our massage times. It generally felt like we were being passed off, staff member to staff member, until I finally went up and asked \"Can we walk around?\" after being ignored for about 10 minutes when they told us to have a seat. ", "Second, Bota Bota was packed. I've been to other spas that require reservations, I think to avoid this exact problem, but there were people everywhere. Even when you're being quiet, having dozens of people opening doors, flip flopping through rooms, splashing in and out of hot tubs... well, it's hard to create any sense of calm with all that background noise. Plus, it meant that there was very little space in the hot tubs, in the relaxation chairs, in the cold tubs... Even trying to sit quietly in the steam room was almost impossible with the door opening every 30 seconds and the room quickly filling up to about 10 people (in a room that definitely was not comfortably meant for that many!) ", "Third, the design of the rooms. I think Bota Bota was going for an open concept kind of feel, with the open winding staircase in the middle, but instead it just creates a giant sound tunnel. Even if the staff were monitoring the level of chattiness, like I said, the pure volume of people just doesn't work when all the relaxation areas are in an open space. They need to somehow partition off the relaxation rooms, to create a quieter, more serene environment. ", "Overall, I could see Bota Bota being a great party environment, and the food was delicious at their restaurant, but we definitely overpaid for the Nordic bathing treatment and I would not recommend this place to anyone for that specific purpose. If you want quiet and relaxing, try the Scandinave Spa across the street. If you want hustle and bustle with some sunshine while you sit in the hot tub or are lucky enough to get one of the lounge chairs outside, then this place might be for you (hence why I'm giving this place a three star review)."]},

In retrospect I feel like the management is now different. Maybe that is their way of stating that? Not sure. \u00a0I ordered the 90 minute foot massage. The masseur \u00a0kept taking loudly to the other therapist \u00a0in a foreign language for the first 20 minutes of my massage. At one point, I heard him giggle. He would stop rubbing to finish his conversation. How annoying is that? \u00a0I did not come to here to hear \u00a0him talk and ramble on, my neck hurts. Also, there was a huge language barrier. He couldn't \u00a0understand what I was saying to him which also made the massage less enjoyable. I had to point and make hand gestures. Overall, once he stopped talking and got the pressure right it really was a great massage. I am member of \u00a0Message Envy but I like coming here for convenience and they really know how to give deep pressure. I have referred many people here as well. It's no frills but typically they do great work. I will continue to come here if conditions improve.

I waited an hour and a half just for my starter -- a small cup of tomato gazpacho -- not sure why that took so long, it's cold and probably was in a large pot ready for the scooping. No one told a few lunch-goers they had to be served in the special dining area so lots of people holding menus who were literally a yard over on the deck chairs were wondering why no one had took their drink order yet.

You also get a nice face, neck, hands and arm massage. Be prepared to come out with your hair a little on the messy side as you do get a head massage. You are then followed by a 30 minute massage of n your fee, calf muscles, ankles, thighs and legs and they also have you flip over on your tummy to have the back of your legs massaged. Extra care and attention is really taken into consideration during your entire massage. You also get a great back and shoulder massage which I feel is worth your money and get more than your moneys worth. ", "I would definetly recommend this place and plan on making future visits."]},
